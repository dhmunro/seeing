<h2>A second story of gravity</h2>

<p class="justified">Shockingly, two centuries after Newton's
  universal gravitation, Albert Einstein invented a completely
  different way to look at gravity, again based on general laws of
  mechanics, but updated to be consistent with new experiments
  involving the speed of light.  Like the step Newton took beyond
  Kepler, Einstein carefully constructed his new picture to be
  equivalent to Newton's everywhere it had been tested up to that
  time.  Deviations begin only in cases involving bodies moving near
  the speed of light - thousands of times faster than anything in the
  solar system.  Therefore, unlike Newton, even today very few
  physicists - let alone engineers - ever use Einstein's theory of
  gravity.  Einstein's math is far more complicated, and errors in
  Newton's theory are usually negligible.</p>

<p class="justified">You will not find any details about Einstein's
  theory of gravity (a.k.a. general relativity) here.  However, you
  will learn how Newton's first law of motion defines the concept of a
  straight line in space-time - the four dimensional universe we all
  inhabit.  Once you know a straight line, you can recognize a curved
  one, and thus glimpse gravity from Einstein's perspective of curved
  space-time.</p>

<h2>Toward space-time geometry</h2>

<p class="justified">You need four dimensions to talk about motion:
  three coordinates to say where and a fourth to say when.  Of course,
  the time dimension is quite different from the other three, so it is
  not at all obvious how to combine space and time into anything like
  geometry.  However, the motion of a solid body, or any tiny particle
  of matter, stitches space and time together: A particle of matter
  traces a path through space-time called its <em>world-line</em> - a
  thread in the time direction connecting points in space at different
  times.  Bodies collide if and only if their world-lines intersect in
  space-time, and the position and time of such a collision is called
  an <em>event</em> - the analog of a Euclidean point.</p>

<p class="justified">Newton thought of space-time as slices of
  constant time.  If you consider motion in two dimensions, like a
  planet in its orbital plane, then these slices - snapshots - are
  stacked like cards in a deck.  Each card has dots (events!)
  marking the positions the planets at one time.  Everyone agrees on
  the relative positions of these dots on each individual card - the
  ordinary two dimensional plane geometry of a snapshot.  The
  fundamental question of space-time geometry, however, is how you
  should stack the cards: What do you mean by "the same point in
  space" at two <em>different</em> times?  How should you line up the
  time slices?  You can shear and fan the cards in a deck in countless
  ways.</p>

<p class="justified">For example, ancient astronomers like Ptolemy
  thought of the Earth as a fixed point in space, while after
  Copernicus astronomers thought of the Sun as fixed in space.  These
  two viewpoints amount to different ways of stacking the
  constant-time slices of space-time.  Newton actually needed a third
  way to stack the deck of time slices in which the Sun is not quite
  stationary - remember that the gravitational force of each planet
  causes the Sun to accelerate slightly.  Instead, the center of mass
  of the whole solar system (computed separately for each time slice)
  is the fixed point in space for Newton.</p>

<p class="justified">Whatever series of points on successive cards you
  choose to represent "the same point" at different times - the
  successive origins of the spatial coordinates on each card - you can
  connect them to form a world line.  You can imagine yourself - the
  observer of the motion - following such a "same point" world line.
  The world line connecting spatial origins always appears "straight"
  and "perpendicular" to the cards, but that very same world line
  appears "curved" if you choose a different world line to define "the
  same point" at different times.  In the case of the planets,
  Ptolemy's choice of the Earth as the spatial origin makes the Sun
  follow a helical path through space-time, while the planets follow
  elaborate epicycles.  On the other hand, Copernicus's choice of the
  Sun makes Earth and all the planets follow similar helices.</p>

<h2>Newton's laws of motion and space-time</h2>

<p class="justified">Ptolemy and Copernicus choose the world-line of
  an actual body - the Earth or the Sun - to be "at rest".  But
  Newton's first law of motion says that only a body experiencing no
  net force will remain at rest (or move in a straight line at a
  constant speed).  Since both the Earth and the Sun experience net
  gravitational forces, neither can be at rest according to the first
  law!  Thus, Newton does not allow you to stack your space-time
  slices however you please.  Instead, with his first law, Newton
  forces you to choose the center of mass of the whole solar system -
  an imaginary point in empty space - to be at rest (or moving with
  constant velocity).</p>

<p class="justified">Thus, the first law drastically restricts your
  freedom to stack constant time slices of space-time.  A stacking
  which satisfies the first law is called an <em>inertial reference
  frame</em>.  Since free bodies must move with constant (possibly
  zero) velocity according to the first law, you see that all inertial
  frames move at constant velocity with respect to one another - you
  can consider any body with no net force acting on it to be at rest,
  but no others.  That is, once you have identified one inertial
  frame, you have found them all.  If you stack the deck of time
  slices such that a body "at rest" has no net force acting on it,
  then the only other stackings corresponding to inertial frames are
  simple linear shears - they just add a fixed velocity to your
  original frame.</p>

<p class="justified">Hence, Newton's first law is really an axiom of
  space-time geometry.  It defines what you mean by
  a <em>straight</em> world-line: A world-line is straight if and only
  if a body moving along it has no net force acting on it.  In the
  case of gravity, Newton uses this axiom in reverse: Since the
  planets do not move with constant velocity, there must be a force -
  gravity - acting upon them.</p>

<p class="justified">Einstein's general theory of relativity amounts
  to a very sharp critique of this argument.  Einstein accepts the
  first law as an axiom, but he points out that Newton's gravitational
  force flagrantly violates the first law of motion!  Imagine that you
  are standing on a spring scale on the surface of a completely
  isolated non-spinning planet.  You and the planet are at rest in
  Newton's inertial frame, but the gravitational force has compressed
  the spring by your weight.  Einstein points out that the compression
  of the spring is clear evidence that you are experiencing an upward
  force equal to your weight.  You can literally feel it pressing
  against the soles of your feet!  Einstein points out that if you did
  not know there was a planet under the scale, Newton's first law
  insists that you cannot remain at rest, since you feel a net upward
  force.</p>

<p class="justified">The problem with Einstein's argument is so
  obvious that no one took it seriously until unrelated small cracks
  began to show in Newtonian mechanics (caused by special relativity):
  If you choose to stack the deck so your world-line is curved upwards
  - that is, so that the spatial origin accelerates downward along
  with freely falling bodies according to the first law - what happens
  to someone standing on the opposite side of the planet?  Your
  downwards is their upwards.  The only choice that makes sense
  globally is Newton's: you are both at rest, and both experience a
  gravitational acceleration toward the center of the planet you
  cannot feel, but which exactly cancels the upward force of the
  spring scale on your feet - the force you do feel.</p>

<h2>Curved space-time</h2>

<p class="justified">Einstein's answer was to abandon Newton's global
  inertial reference frame.
</p>

<p class="justified">A non-inertial reference frame often offers the
  simplest framework for talking about a phenomenon.  For example, you
  usually choose the ground to be fixed when you discuss the motion of
  projectiles near Earth's surface, despite the fact that the ground
  rotates with the Earth, which rotates around the Sun - the ground is
  not an inertial frame!  When you do choose a rotating or otherwise
  accelerated reference frame, you must take into account forces, such
  as the centrifugal force and the Coriolis force, which depend on the
  acceleration of your reference frame, and which would not be present
  had you chosen an inertial frame.</p>

<p class="justified">These frame dependent forces share a very
  striking feature of gravitational force: The force on a body is
  always proportional to its mass - always producing the same
  acceleration independent of mass.  The reason is this common
  acceleration (or its negative) really belongs the reference frame.
  Einstein proposed that what Newton called gravitational force was of
  exactly the same character as, say, centrifugal force - namely that
  Newton has chosen to work in a non-inertial reference frame.</p>

<p class="justified">However, in order for Einstein's proposal to
  make any sense, he has to change the rules Newton played by: Newton
  only permitted you to make a single choice of reference frame - once
  you choose how to stack them, you have to stick with your choice
  once and for all.  Einstein dispensed with this one-choice rule,
  allowing you to change the way you stack the time slices as often as
  you please, choosing your stacking to apply for only a limited
  region of space and time around the current position of the bodies
  of interest.</p>

<p class="justified">If you allow your space-time model this
  flexibility, you can indeed eliminate all gravitational forces,
  instead ascribing the gravitational acceleration to your local
  inertial frame relative to Newton's global inertial frame.  In other
  words, Einstein permits gravity to locally bend the way you stack
  time-slices; gravity curves space-time.  (As long as nothing moves
  near lightspeed, the slices of constant time are always ordinary
  flat three dimensional space - the curvature is entirely in the
  stacking of these slices.)</p>

<p class="justified">To be clear, Einstein is not saying that Newton's
  reference frame is <em>wrong</em>, merely that it is
  a <em>choice</em>.  If you do choose to work in Newton's frame (as
  nearly everyone still does today), then you interpret the motion of
  bodies to be influenced by gravitational forces, exactly as Newton
  did.  What Einstein is saying is that instead of taking this view,
  you can instead imagine that any acceleration you observe belongs to
  a local inertial frame of reference, which is falling along with the
  object.  In other words, a body with no forces being applied to it,
  like an orbiting spacecraft, drags along its own inertial reference
  frame in which it is always at rest.  It is not the body that is
  falling around its orbit, but this constantly changing reference
  frame.
</p>

<p class="justified">What Newton calls an inertial frame is infinite
  in extent both in space and time, and only bodies infinitely far
  from any gravitating mass have motions satisfying his first law.
  With such a reference frame, you need to account for gravitational
  forces and their accelerations.  Einstein, on the other hand, allows
  you to choose local inertial reference frames, like the one moving
  along with a spacecraft, which are limited in extent both in space
  and time.  In those local frames, there are no gravitational forces
  or accelerations.  Instead, you need to slowly update the
  acceleration of your local inertial frame relative to Newton's
  global inertial frame.  What Newton calls gravitational
  acceleration, Einstein permits you to call (negative) acceleration
  of your local inertial frame.</p>

<p class="justified">Even Newton lamented the action-at-a-distance
  feature of his inverse square law.  Einstein is pointing out that
  this is really a feature of the global reference frame Newton is
  choosing.  If you use only local inertial frames, there is no longer
  a problem with action-at-a-distance, because you can dispense with
  the inverse square force law entirely.  But to do this, Einstein has
  paid a very heavy price - to track planetary orbits, he must patch
  together a huge number of tiny local inertial frames, following the
  planet as it moves around the Sun.  Newton's gravitational field he
  re-interprets as the (negative) acceleration of each of these
  reference frame patches, rather than as an acceleration caused by
  any gravitational force.  In other words, the gravitational field
  tells you the acceleration of a local inertial frame (relative to
  Newton's global frame), and the planet always travels in a straight
  line through space-time in its current local reference frame.</p>

<hr/>

<p class="justified">Once you have defined a straight world-line, you
  can, of course, recognize a curved world-line.  Newton's second law
  of motion supplies a measure of the curvature of the world-line of a
  body: its acceleration.  That is, acceleration is what you mean by
  the <em>curvature</em> of space-time - how much world-lines deviate
  from being straight.  The rubber sheets you sometimes see to
  illustrate Einstein's ideas about space-time curvature are terribly
  misleading.  Curved space-time has nothing to do with the three
  dimensions of space being warped, at least for low speed motions
  like the planets in the solar system.  Three dimensional space in
  the solar system is perfectly flat and Euclidean - the curvature is
  all in the time direction.  Acceleration is the space-time analog of
  curvature.</p>

<hr/>

<p class="justified">These are all statements of experimental fact - a
  distillation of decades, if not millenia, of careful observations of
  the sky.  This massive data reduction required great skill in
  mathematics, ranging from geometry and arithmetic through calculus -
  and every single one of those skills was developed, at least in
  part, to work specifically on the problem of planetary motion.</p>

<p class="justified">Separately, Newton formulated three general laws
  of motion by thinking about the mechanics of earthbound objects.
  His theory of gravity emerges when you interpret the experimental
  laws of planetary motion according to these general laws of
  mechanics.  This bold idea - essentially that the Earth and heavenly
  bodies are just very large rocks - follows directly from the
  experimental fact that apples and the Moon follow the inverse square
  acceleration law.  In other words, you already know that the gravity
  you feel on Earth is what holds the Moon in its orbit.  What if the
  pull of Earth extends all the way to the Sun?  Indeed, what if the
  Sun and Jupiter extert their own gravitational pull to hold their
  planets and moons in orbit?  What if every particle of matter pulls
  on every other?</p>

<p class="justified">Isaac Newton, the great mathematician,
  translated <a href="./seeing.html">Kepler's laws</a> of planetary
  motion into an <a href="./touching.html">inverse square law</a> of
  acceleration.  From the fact that the Moon, 60 times farther from
  Earth's center than we are, moves with a downward acceleration 3600
  (60&sup2;) times less than objects we drop on Earth's surface,
  Newton the great physicist deduced that the gravity we all feel at
  the surface of the Earth is exactly what keeps the Moon circling the
  Earth.  Gravity not holds us down, it is binds the whole solar
  system together.</p>

<p class="justified">The reason Newton was thinking about acceleration
  in the first place was to apply his general theory of mechanics -
  how things move - to the planets.  When he did, he discovered a
  universal law of gravity.  Universal gravitation explains why the
  Moon does not accurately orbit according to Kepler's laws, how the
  Moon and Sun produce ocean tides, the tiny deviations in in
  planetary orbits from Kepler's laws, and many other puzzles.</p>

<p class="justified">Here you will follow Newton's physical reasoning
  about mechanics and planetary motion.  Although Newton's model of
  gravity remains the easiest way to think about both solar system
  dynamics and motion in general, and despite its overwhelming success
  in describing a wide variety of phenomena, Einstein pointed out a
  different way to picture gravity.  Just as Newton's model of gravity
  began as a different, but equivalent, way to think about Kepler's
  laws of planetary motion, so Einstein's model of gravity begins as a
  different, but equivalent, way to think about Newton's inverse
  square force law.  All three pictures remain relevant today -
  astronomers choose the viewpoint best suited to describe the problem
  at hand.</p>

<h2>Mass and weight</h2>

<p class="justified">The translated Kepler's laws state that any
  bodies at the same distance from an attracting center will share a
  common <em>acceleration</em>, no matter their size: A cannonball
  and a bullet accelerate downward at the same rate, and a comet is
  accelerating toward the Sun at the same rate as Earth when it
  crosses Earth's orbit.  That means the gravitational <em>force</em>
  must be directly proportional to the mass of the falling body,
  according to Newton's second law of motion.</p>

<p class="justified">However, if gravity pulls you toward the Earth,
  then Newton's third law says you must pull up on the Earth with an
  equal force - the force down on you is the action, and the force up
  on the Earth is the equal and opposite reaction.  Similarly, if the
  gravity of the Sun holds the Earth in orbit, the Earth must pull
  back with the same force on the Sun.  The second law told you the
  Sun's gravitational force on the Earth is proportional to Earth's
  mass, since you know that any sized object at the same distance
  would share the same acceleration.  Since this is the
</p>

<p class="justified">Thus, conservation of momentum requires that the
  gravitational force between two bodies be proportional to both
  masses.  On the other hand, as far as Newton was concerned, the
  inverse square law for gravitational force is a purely experimental
  fact - a feature of Kepler's laws of planetary motion.
</p>

<h2>Equal and opposite reaction</h2>

<p class="justified">Newton knew from Kepler that the planets
  <em>accelerate</em> directly toward the Sun at a rate inversely
  proportional to the square of their distance.  Thus, since
  F&nbsp;=&nbsp;ma, the Sun must pull on the planet with
  a <em>force</em> proportional to the mass of the planet (and
  inversely proportional to the square of the distance).  But you also
  know that each planet (or both Jupiter and Earth, at least) causes
  things to accelerate toward it according to an inverse square
  distance law.  If this plantary inverse square law extends all the
  way to the Sun, then the planet must be causing the Sun to
  accelerate (very slightly) toward it as well - which means the
  planet pulls on the Sun with a force proportional to the solar
  mass.</p>

<p class="justified">But the force of the Sun pulling on the planet
  must equal the force of the planet pulling on the Sun, since actions
  must have equal and opposite reactions.  (The forces are clearly in
  opposite directions along the Sun-planet line.)  Since the pull of
  the Sun is proportional to the planet's mass and the pull of the
  planet proportional to the Sun's mass, the Sun-planet force must be
  directly proportional to <em>both</em> masses, as well as inversely
  proportional to the square of the distance.  From this, Newton
  proposed his law of universal gravitation - that a force acts
  between <em>any</em> pair of bodies directly proportional to both
  masses, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance
  between them, F&nbsp;=&nbsp;GMm/r&sup2.</p>

<p class="justified">Notice that the inverse square law acceleration
  constant for a body of mass M is GM, directly proportional to its
  mass.  Thus, Newton deduced that the Sun is roughly a thousand times
  the mass of Jupiter, while Jupiter is a bit over three hundred times
  the mass of Earth, since those are the ratios of their acceleration
  constants from Kepler's laws.  This is still the only way we know
  the masses of stars, planets, asteroids, or black holes - by
  measuring the accelerations of nearby objects.</p>

<p class="justified">On the one hand, universal gravitation represents
  a huge simplification - a single inverse square force law explains
  all manner of phenomena, from the motion of the planets or
  cannonballs to the tides.  On the other hand, you realize that in
  order to compute the motion of any object, you need to account for
  the forces between every rock and drop of fluid in the whole
  universe!  Every pair of rocks attract each other, so actually
  applying the "simple" law can become very complicated indeed.</p>
