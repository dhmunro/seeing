<h2>Two stories of gravity</h2>

<p class="justified">Isaac Newton invented physics with his theory of
  universal gravitation to explain planetary motion: Every pair of
  bodies attract each another by a force directly proportional to both
  masses, and inversely proportional to the distance between them,
  F&nbsp;=&nbspGMm/r&sup2;.  As you will see, he arrived at this rule
  by applying his ideas about force and motion to the orbits of
  planets and moons in the solar system.  This combination of abstract
  theory - three mathematical laws of motion - with experimental
  observations - Kepler's description of planetary motion - has served
  as the archetype for physical science ever since.</p>

<p class="justified">The impact of Newton's work on the way we think
  about and work with nature cannot be overstated.  The excitement
  over understanding celestial mechanics very quickly spread
  throughout the scientific and engineering world as people began to
  apply Newton's mathematical modeling approach to countless different
  problems.  Newtonian mechanics ignited, then fueled the industrial
  revolution.</p>

<p class="justified">Shockingly, two centuries after Newton, Albert
  Einstein invented a completely different way to picture gravity,
  also based on general laws of mechanics, but updated to be
  consistent with new experiments involving the speed of light.  Like
  the step Newton took beyond Kepler, Einstein's new picture is
  carefully constructed to be equivalent to Newton's everywhere it had
  been tested up to that time.  Deviations begin only in cases
  involving bodies moving near the speed of light - thousands of times
  faster than anything in the solar system.  Therefore, unlike Newton,
  even today very few physicists - let alone engineers - ever use
  Einstein's theory of gravity.  Einstein's math is far more
  complicated, and errors in Newton's theory are usually
  negligible.</p>

<p class="justified">You will not find any details about Einstein's
  theory of gravity (a.k.a. general relativity) here.  However, you
  will learn how Newton's first law of motion defines the concept of a
  straight line in space-time - the four dimensional universe we all
  inhabit.  Once you know a straight line, you can recognize a curved
  one, and thus glimpse gravity from Einstein's perspective of curved
  space-time.  Even Newton disliked the action-at-a-distance feature
  of his universal gravitation - the fact that the force law connects
  things across great distances of empty space.  In contrast,
  Einstein's geometrical picture is local from the beginning.</p>

<h2>Newton's laws of motion and gravity</h2>

<ol>
<li>A body at rest stays at rest, and a body in motion
  stays in motion in a straight line at a constant speed, unless
  acted on by a force.</li>
<li>The force on a body is directly proportional to, and in the same
  direction as, its acceleration.  The constant of proportionality is
  the mass of the body.</li>
<li>To every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.  That is,
  the forces of two bodies on each other are always equal and in
  opposite directions.</li>
</ol>

<p class="justified">The first law is, in a sense, a special case of
  the second - namely the case of zero force.  However, the first law
  really <em>defines</em> what "straight line" means in space-time
  according to Einstein, as you'll see later.  The second law is the
  iconic F&nbsp;=&nbsp;ma, which defines both force and mass in a
  deliberately circular manner.  The third law is what physicists now
  call <em>conservation of momentum</em>.</p>

<p class="justified">When he applied these general laws of motion to
  the case of planets, Newton learned something completely new: mass
  is the source of gravity.  His reasoning is quite simple, but turns
  out to be very deep.  (The technically difficult part of universal
  gravitation is figuring out that Kepler's laws are equivalent to an
  inverse square law of acceleration - see
  <a href="./touching.html">Touching the Solar System</a>.)</p>

<p class="justified">At a given instant of time, you know from
  Kepler's laws that the Earth is accelerating directly toward the Sun
  at at a rate inversely proportional to the square of the distance
  between them, say a&nbsp;=&nbsp;K/r&sup2.  Furthermore, things
  accelerate directly toward the Earth according to a different
  inverse square law, say g&nbsp;=&nbsp;k/r&sup2, where the Earth's
  constant of proportionality k is smaller than the Sun's K by a
  factor of about 330,000.  The second law of motion asserts that the
  force of the Sun pulling on Earth is proportional to the mass m of
  the Earth, F&nbsp;=&nbsp;ma, and also that the force of the Earth
  pulling on the Sun is proportional to the mass M of the Sun,
  F&nbsp;=&nbsp;Mg.</p>

<p class="justified">Enter the third law: The force of the Sun pulling
  on the Earth must equal the force of the Earth pulling on the Sun,
  F&nbsp;=&nbsp;ma&nbsp;=&nbsp;Mg.  (They act in opposite directions
  along the line connecting them.)  Newton's law of equal action and
  reaction plus the experimental inverse square acceleration laws for
  the Sun and Earth require that the observed ratio of acceleration
  constants K/k must equal the ratio of masses M/m (and the ratio of
  accelerations a/g).  Thus, the Sun must be 330,000 times more
  massive that the Earth.</p>

<p class="justified">Furthermore, the ratio K/M must equal k/m.
  Newton called this ratio G.  You could have made this argument with
  Jupiter or any other planet instead of Earth, so the ratio
  G&nbsp;=&nbsp;K/M must be the same for every body.  In other words,
  any two bodies attract each other with a force proportional to both
  masses, F&nbsp;=&nbsp;GMm/r&sup2;, where G is a universal constant
  of nature - the first such constant ever discovered.  Since the
  acceleration constants K&nbsp;=&nbsp;GM and k&nbsp;=&nbsp;Gm, this
  universal law of gravitational force identifies the <em>mass</em> of
  any object as the <em>source</em> of the gravitational acceleration
  of all other objects toward it.</p>

<h2>Gravitational field lines</h2>

<p class="justified">Gravity is an acceleration vector at every point
  in space - the gravitational acceleration a small mass would
  experience at that point.  According to universal gravitation, to
  compute this, you have to add the acceleration vectors GM/r&sup2;
  directed toward every other particle of mass M and distance r in the
  universe.  Start this program by considering the acceleration
  produced by just a single idealized point mass - a particle so much
  smaller than its distance r that you can ignore its dimensions.  The
  planets are good examples of point masses, since they appear as mere
  pinpoints of light from anywhere else in the solar system.</p>

<p class="justified">A vector associated with every point in space is
  called a <em>vector field</em>.  Faraday invented a way to visualize
  vector fields about a century after Newton's death.  Faraday
  pictured lines of force filling space - a force field.  He was
  looking at the lines traced by iron filings on a sheet of paper with
  a magnet beneath, but the picture works for gravity as well.  The
  idea is to connect the vectors into (possibly curved) lines - the
  path you would follow if you kept moving in the direction the
  vectors point.  So you picture the gravity of a point mass as myriad
  radial rays converging to the point, like long pins in a tiny
  pincushion.  Each ray is called a <em>field line</em>.  Notice that
  a field line is a <em>directed</em> line - like a one-way street.
  This field picture captures the direction of the acceleration vector
  everywhere, but at first glance it seems to lose any indication of
  magnitude - the length of the arrow.</p>

<p class="justified">However, notice that the spacing between the
  lines decreases as they converge to the point mass.  You can measure
  their density at a given position along some field line by imagining
  a small loop around the field line.  The loop will encircle other
  nearby lines, and you can define the density of field lines at that
  location to be the number of field lines threading through this tiny
  loop, divided by the area of the loop.  If you move farther away
  from the point mass, you need to scale up the diameter of the loop
  in proportion to the distance for it to encircle a fixed set of
  field lines, so the loop area scales as the square of the distance
  from the point mass.  Thus, the number of field lines per unit area
  scales inversely as the square of the distance!  If you make the
  total number of lines emanating from the point proportional to its
  mass, the magnitude of the gravitational acceleration will be
  proportional to the number of field lines per unit area!</p>

<p class="justified">So far, you assumed the plane of the loop was
  perpendicular to the field lines.  What happens if the plane of the
  loop is tilted relative to the field lines?  The number of lines
  threading the loop will be proportional to the area of the
  projection of the loop into the plane perpendicular to the field
  line.  The ratio of that projected area to the loop area when it was
  oriented normally is exactly the same as the ratio of the component
  of the acceleration normal to the tilted loop to the full
  acceleration, which is the component along the field line.
  Therefore, for any small loop, the <em>component</em> of
  acceleration normal to the plane of the loop is the number of field
  lines threading the loop per unit area.  More subtly, you need to
  choose the sign of the component to be negative if the directed
  field lines thread the loop in the direction opposite to its
  normal.</p>

<h2>Field line geometry</h2>

<p class="justified">Newton faced an immediate technical problem with
  this theory of universal gravitation: In the argument that the
  Earth's gravity diminishes as the square of distance between your
  downward acceleration on its surface and the acceleration of the
  Moon in its orbit, you assumed that your "distance from the Earth"
  was the radius of the Earth, that is, your distance from the center
  of the Earth.  But with universal gravitation, the idea is that each
  little piece of the Earth - every rock and grain of sand and drop of
  magma in the whole ball - is individually pulling on you.  When you
  add up all those individual forces in different directions, why
  should you get the same answer as if all that mass were concentrated
  at the center of the Earth?  Unlike Newton, you can use the field
  line picture to answer this question.</p>

<p class="justified">Imagine a closed surface of any size (eventually
  this will be the surface of the Earth).  A point mass at some
  arbitrary position produces an acceleration which varies varies as
  you move around to different points on the surface.  The component
  of that vector normal to the surface (take the inward normal) thus
  also varies around the surface.  The field picture makes it easy to
  compute the area-weighted <em>average</em> of this normal component
  of acceleration over the whole surface: Since the normal
  acceleration component is the number of lines per unit area
  threading any small loop on the surface, its area-weighted average
  is just the total number of field lines piercing the surface divided
  by the total surface area!  The one caveat is that you have to count
  each inward piercing line as plus one, and each outward piercing
  line as minus one, in order to be consistent about the sign of the
  acceleration relative to the surface.</p>

<p class="justified">There are two cases: First, if the point mass is
  outside the surface, then each field line pierces the surface twice
  - once going inward and a second time going outward, so the net
  number of piercings is zero.  Second, if the point mass is inside
  the surface, then each field line pierces just once, on its way
  inward.  (If the surface is not convex, there may be additional
  pairs of inward and outward piercings for some rays, but such pairs
  cancel each other.)  Thus, if the point mass is outside the surface,
  the mean value of the normal component of gravitational acceleration
  over the whole surface is always zero.  When the point mass is
  inside the surface, on the other hand, the mean value of the normal
  acceleration is always the total number of field lines emanating
  from the point mass, divided by the total surface area.  The average
  inward acceleration is proportional to the mass inside the closed
  surface divided by its surface area.</p>

<p class="justified">A second point mass adds its acceleration vector
  to the acceleration from the first at every point in space.  Because
  the acceleration vectors simply add, the <em>averages</em> of the
  inward component of the acceleration also simply add.  Thus, if the
  new point is inside the surface, the average increases by the new
  mass divided by the surface area, otherwise the new mass contributes
  nothing.  Thus, the inverse square law of universal gravitation has
  the remarkable property that the average value of the inward
  acceleration over <em>any</em> closed surface is simply proportional
  the the total mass inside that surface, divided by the surface
  area.</p>

<p class="justified">For any spherically symmetric object, the
  acceleration at its surface must point directly inward toward the
  center, and have the same value at every point of the surface -
  which is therefore the average inward component of the acceleration.
  Thus, the gravitational acceleration at the surface depends only on
  the total mass of the object divided by the surface area.  How the
  mass is distributed does not matter, as long as it is spherically
  symmetric (otherwise the acceleration would differ from place to
  place around the surface).  In particular, the acceleration at the
  surface is the same as if all the mass were condensed to a single
  point at its center.  You have resolved Newton's technical problem,
  and universal gravitation has passed an important consistency
  test.</p>

<hr/>

<p class="justified">By construction, any of those field lines is
  parallel to the gravitational acceleration at any location on the
  line.  Choose the lines to be uniformly distributed in direction.
  Imagine a series of spherical surfaces centered on the mass point.
  If you draw a narrow cone, it will intersect any of the spheres in a
  small circle, and it is clear that the number of rays passing
  through that circle is the same for all the spheres.  Here's the
  clever part: The area of any circle is proportional to the square of
  the radius of its sphere, which means that the <em>density</em> of
  the field lines - the number of lines per unit area on any sphere -
  falls inversely as the square of the distance from the mass point at
  its center.  Therefore, in this gravitational field picture, the
  direction of the acceleration is the direction of the field line,
  and the strength of the field is proportional to the density of
  field lines - meaning the number per unit area transverse to the
  field direction.  Field lines are a geometrical model of the
  inversse square law.</p>

<p class="justified">The small circles on the spheres are oriented
  normal to the radial field lines, so the number of field lines per
  unit area passing through a circle is proportional to the component
  of the field normal to the circle.  If the circle were tilted ninety
  degrees so its plane was vertical, then no field lines would pass
  through it - and the horizontal component of the field, that is the
  component normal to a vertical circle, also is zero.  Hence, for
  both a horizontal and a vertical circle, the number of field lines
  per unit area passing through the circle is proportional to the
  component of the field normal to the circle.  By projecting a circle
  oriented at any intermediate tilt angle into a horizontal plane
  (tangent to one of the spheres), you can see tha the number of field
  lines passing through the circle will always be proportional to the
  component of the field normal to the circle.</p>

<p class="justified">This picture of field lines makes it particularly
  easy to understand why any spherical mass distribution produces
  exactly the same gravitational acceleration outside the sphere as if
  all the mass were concentrated at the center of the sphere.  By the
  assumed spherical symmetry, you know that the total gravitational
  acceleration everywhere must be directed toward the center of the
  sphere.</p>

<p class="justified">Consider the gravitational attraction between you
  on the surface, and some arbitrary speck of matter inside the
  sphere.  Imagine the gravitational field lines emanating from that
  speck.  Remember that the number of field lines per unit area
  passing through any small patch on the surface of the sphere is
  proportional to the component of the field normal to the patch, that
  is, to the component of the field that points straight toward the
  center.  The radial component naturally varies from location to
  location on the surface, larger the closer the location is to the
  speck.  But the <em>average</em> of the radial component of the
  field is easy to compute - just add up the total number of field
  lines passing through any set of small patches covering the whole
  surface of the Earth and divide by the total area of all the
  patches.  But no matter where the speck is inside the Earth, that is
  just the total number of field lines divided by the total surface
  area of the Earth.  That is, the <em>average</em> radial component
  of the gravitational field over the whole surface of the Earth is
  always exactly the same, no matter where the speck is located inside
  the Earth!</p>

<p class="justified">Do you see it?  If you add specks of the same
  tiny mass anywhere inside the sphere, the average radial component
  of the gravitational field just increases proportionally to the mass
  you've added.  Furthermore, you can rearrange the positions of the
  specks however you like within the sphere without changing the
  average.  In particlar, the arrangement with all of the specks
  crammed into the center will produce exactly the same average radial
  component of the gravitational acceleration at the surface as any
  other arrangement of mass inside the sphere.  Since any spherically
  symmetric arrangement of mass produces the same gravitational
  acceleration at every point on the surface, that common value is
  clearly the average value, which is the same for any arrangement of
  mass!</p>

<p class="justified">Newton's theory of universal gravitation, the
  notion that every individual speck of matter attracts every other,
  passes this first internal consistency check: Because of the inverse
  square law, a spherically symmetric body - an idealized Earth - does
  indeed produce the same gravitational acceleration everywhere
  outside it, as if all its mass were concentrated at its center.  The
  picture of gravitational field lines aligned with the direction of
  acceleration, with the number of lines per unit area representing
  the magnitude of the acceleration, gives you some powerful insight
  into the geometrical nature of the inverse square law.</p>

<hr/>

<p class="justified">Obviously it can't be <em>exactly</em> true,
  because the Earth isn't <em>exactly</em> spherical, so it's not
  obvious what "center" even means.  Instead, you have to ask the
  question for an idealized perfectly spherically symmetric Earth.
  The gravitational force or acceleration anywhere outside such an
  idealized Earth must certainly be directed toward its center: If you
  divide such an Earth into two hemispheres by any vertical plane
  (containing you and Earth's center), then the vertical components of
  the gravitational forces between you and each half must be the same,
  while the horizontal components normal to the plane must cancel.  So
  the direction of the force is clearly straight downward toward the
  center, and the only question is if its magnitude is the same as if
  all the mass were concentrated at the center.</p>

<p class="justified">The planets move according to Kepler's laws,
  which are equivalent to a single inverse square law: The planets are
  always accelerating directly toward the Sun at a rate inversely
  proportional to the Sun-planet distance squared.  Comets with highly
  elliptical orbits are accelerating according to the same law, that
  is, at the same rate as the planets when at the same distance from
  the Sun.  The Galilean moons of Jupiter obey the same law relative
  to Jupiter, but with a constant of proportionality a thousand times
  smaller than the planets and comets relative to the Sun.  Finally,
  the acceleration of our Moon is smaller than the acceleration of a
  falling apple by the square of the ratio of their distances from the
  center of the Earth.  The inverse square acceleration law constant
  for Earth is roughly three hundred times smaller than for
  Jupiter.</p>

<p class="justified">These are all statements of experimental fact - a
  distillation of decades, if not millenia, of careful observations of
  the sky.  This massive data reduction required great skill in
  mathematics, ranging from geometry and arithmetic through calculus -
  and every single one of those skills was developed, at least in
  part, to work specifically on the problem of planetary motion.</p>

<p class="justified">Separately, Newton formulated three general laws
  of motion by thinking about the mechanics of earthbound objects.
  His theory of gravity emerges when you interpret the experimental
  laws of planetary motion according to these general laws of
  mechanics.  This bold idea - essentially that the Earth and heavenly
  bodies are just very large rocks - follows directly from the
  experimental fact that apples and the Moon follow the inverse square
  acceleration law.  In other words, you already know that the gravity
  you feel on Earth is what holds the Moon in its orbit.  What if the
  pull of Earth extends all the way to the Sun?  Indeed, what if the
  Sun and Jupiter extert their own gravitational pull to hold their
  planets and moons in orbit?  What if every particle of matter pulls
  on every other?</p>

<p class="justified">Isaac Newton, the great mathematician,
  translated <a href="./seeing.html">Kepler's laws</a> of planetary
  motion into an <a href="./touching.html">inverse square law</a> of
  acceleration.  From the fact that the Moon, 60 times farther from
  Earth's center than we are, moves with a downward acceleration 3600
  (60&sup2;) times less than objects we drop on Earth's surface,
  Newton the great physicist deduced that the gravity we all feel at
  the surface of the Earth is exactly what keeps the Moon circling the
  Earth.  Gravity not holds us down, it is binds the whole solar
  system together.</p>

<p class="justified">The reason Newton was thinking about acceleration
  in the first place was to apply his general theory of mechanics -
  how things move - to the planets.  When he did, he discovered a
  universal law of gravity.  Universal gravitation explains why the
  Moon does not accurately orbit according to Kepler's laws, how the
  Moon and Sun produce ocean tides, the tiny deviations in in
  planetary orbits from Kepler's laws, and many other puzzles.</p>

<p class="justified">Here you will follow Newton's physical reasoning
  about mechanics and planetary motion.  Although Newton's model of
  gravity remains the easiest way to think about both solar system
  dynamics and motion in general, and despite its overwhelming success
  in describing a wide variety of phenomena, Einstein pointed out a
  different way to picture gravity.  Just as Newton's model of gravity
  began as a different, but equivalent, way to think about Kepler's
  laws of planetary motion, so Einstein's model of gravity begins as a
  different, but equivalent, way to think about Newton's inverse
  square force law.  All three pictures remain relevant today -
  astronomers choose the viewpoint best suited to describe the problem
  at hand.</p>

<h2>Mass and weight</h2>

<p class="justified">The translated Kepler's laws state that any
  bodies at the same distance from an attracting center will share a
  common <em>acceleration</em>, no matter their size: A cannonball
  and a bullet accelerate downward at the same rate, and a comet is
  accelerating toward the Sun at the same rate as Earth when it
  crosses Earth's orbit.  That means the gravitational <em>force</em>
  must be directly proportional to the mass of the falling body,
  according to Newton's second law of motion.</p>

<p class="justified">However, if gravity pulls you toward the Earth,
  then Newton's third law says you must pull up on the Earth with an
  equal force - the force down on you is the action, and the force up
  on the Earth is the equal and opposite reaction.  Similarly, if the
  gravity of the Sun holds the Earth in orbit, the Earth must pull
  back with the same force on the Sun.  The second law told you the
  Sun's gravitational force on the Earth is proportional to Earth's
  mass, since you know that any sized object at the same distance
  would share the same acceleration.  Since this is the
</p>

<p class="justified">Thus, conservation of momentum requires that the
  gravitational force between two bodies be proportional to both
  masses.  On the other hand, as far as Newton was concerned, the
  inverse square law for gravitational force is a purely experimental
  fact - a feature of Kepler's laws of planetary motion.
</p>

<h2>Equal and opposite reaction</h2>

<p class="justified">Newton knew from Kepler that the planets
  <em>accelerate</em> directly toward the Sun at a rate inversely
  proportional to the square of their distance.  Thus, since
  F&nbsp;=&nbsp;ma, the Sun must pull on the planet with
  a <em>force</em> proportional to the mass of the planet (and
  inversely proportional to the square of the distance).  But you also
  know that each planet (or both Jupiter and Earth, at least) causes
  things to accelerate toward it according to an inverse square
  distance law.  If this plantary inverse square law extends all the
  way to the Sun, then the planet must be causing the Sun to
  accelerate (very slightly) toward it as well - which means the
  planet pulls on the Sun with a force proportional to the solar
  mass.</p>

<p class="justified">But the force of the Sun pulling on the planet
  must equal the force of the planet pulling on the Sun, since actions
  must have equal and opposite reactions.  (The forces are clearly in
  opposite directions along the Sun-planet line.)  Since the pull of
  the Sun is proportional to the planet's mass and the pull of the
  planet proportional to the Sun's mass, the Sun-planet force must be
  directly proportional to <em>both</em> masses, as well as inversely
  proportional to the square of the distance.  From this, Newton
  proposed his law of universal gravitation - that a force acts
  between <em>any</em> pair of bodies directly proportional to both
  masses, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance
  between them, F&nbsp;=&nbsp;GMm/r&sup2.</p>

<p class="justified">Notice that the inverse square law acceleration
  constant for a body of mass M is GM, directly proportional to its
  mass.  Thus, Newton deduced that the Sun is roughly a thousand times
  the mass of Jupiter, while Jupiter is a bit over three hundred times
  the mass of Earth, since those are the ratios of their acceleration
  constants from Kepler's laws.  This is still the only way we know
  the masses of stars, planets, asteroids, or black holes - by
  measuring the accelerations of nearby objects.</p>

<p class="justified">On the one hand, universal gravitation represents
  a huge simplification - a single inverse square force law explains
  all manner of phenomena, from the motion of the planets or
  cannonballs to the tides.  On the other hand, you realize that in
  order to compute the motion of any object, you need to account for
  the forces between every rock and drop of fluid in the whole
  universe!  Every pair of rocks attract each other, so actually
  applying the "simple" law can become very complicated indeed.</p>
