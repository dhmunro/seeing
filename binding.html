<h2>Two stories of gravity</h2>

<p class="justified">Isaac Newton invented physics with his theory of
  universal gravitation to explain planetary motion: Every pair of
  bodies attract each another by a force directly proportional to both
  masses, and inversely proportional to the distance between them,
  F&nbsp;=&nbspGMm/r&sup2;.  As you will see, he arrived at this rule
  by applying his ideas about force and motion to the orbits of
  planets and moons in the solar system.  This combination of abstract
  theory - three mathematical laws of motion - with experimental
  observations - Kepler's description of planetary motion - has served
  as the archetype for physical science ever since.</p>

<p class="justified">The impact of Newton's work on the way we think
  about and work with nature cannot be overstated.  The excitement
  over understanding celestial mechanics very quickly spread
  throughout the scientific and engineering world as people began to
  apply Newton's mathematical modeling approach to countless different
  problems.  Newtonian mechanics ignited, then fueled the industrial
  revolution.</p>

<p class="justified">Shockingly, two centuries after Newton, Albert
  Einstein invented a completely different way to picture gravity,
  also based on general laws of mechanics, but updated to be
  consistent with new experiments involving the speed of light.  Like
  the step Newton took beyond Kepler, Einstein's new picture is
  carefully constructed to be equivalent to Newton's everywhere it had
  been tested up to that time.  Deviations begin only in cases
  involving bodies moving near the speed of light - thousands of times
  faster than anything in the solar system.  Therefore, unlike Newton,
  even today very few physicists - let alone engineers - ever use
  Einstein's theory of gravity.  Einstein's math is far more
  complicated, and errors in Newton's theory are usually
  negligible.</p>

<p class="justified">You will not find any details about Einstein's
  theory of gravity (a.k.a. general relativity) here.  However, you
  will learn how Newton's first law of motion defines the concept of a
  straight line in space-time - the four dimensional universe we all
  inhabit.  Once you know a straight line, you can recognize a curved
  one, and thus glimpse gravity from Einstein's perspective of curved
  space-time.  Even Newton disliked the action-at-a-distance feature
  of his universal gravitation - the fact that the force law connects
  things across great distances of empty space.  In contrast,
  Einstein's geometrical picture is local from the beginning.</p>

<h2>Newton's laws of motion</h2>

<ol>
<li>A body at rest stays at rest, and a body in motion
  stays in motion in a straight line at a constant speed, unless
  acted on by a force.</li>
<li>The force on a body is directly proportional to, and in the same
  direction as, its acceleration.  The constant of proportionality is
  the mass of the body.</li>
<li>To every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.  That is,
  the forces of two bodies on each other are always equal and in
  opposite directions.</li>
</ol>

<p class="justified">The first law is, in a sense, a special case of
  the second - namely the case of zero force.  However, Einstein
  recognized that the first law really <em>defines</em> what "straight
  line" means in space-time, which led him to his principle of
  equivalence between gravity and acceleration.  The second law is the
  iconic F&nbsp;=&nbsp;ma, which defines both force and mass in a
  deliberately circular manner.  The third law is what physicists now
  call <em>conservation of momentum</em>.</p>

<p class="justified">When he applied these general laws of motion to
  the case of planets, Newton learned something completely new: mass
  is the source of gravity.  His reasoning is quite simple, but turns
  out to be very deep.  (The technically difficult part of universal
  gravitation is figuring out that Kepler's laws are equivalent to an
  inverse square law of acceleration - see
  <a href="./touching.html">Touching the Solar System</a>.)</p>

<p class="justified">At a given instant of time, you know from
  Kepler's laws that the Earth is accelerating directly toward the Sun
  at at a rate inversely proportional to the square of the distance
  between them, say a&nbsp;=&nbsp;K/r&sup2.  Furthermore, things
  accelerate directly toward the Earth according to a different
  inverse square law, say g&nbsp;=&nbsp;k/r&sup2, where the Earth's
  constant of proportionality k is smaller than the Sun's K by a
  factor of about 330,000.  The second law of motion asserts that the
  force of the Sun pulling on Earth is proportional to the mass m of
  the Earth, F&nbsp;=&nbsp;ma, but also that the force of the Earth
  pulling on the Sun is proportional to the mass M of the Sun,
  F&nbsp;=&nbsp;Mg.</p>

<p class="justified">Enter the third law: The force of the Sun pulling
  on the Earth must equal the force of the Earth pulling on the Sun,
  F&nbsp;=&nbsp;ma&nbsp;=&nbsp;Mg.  (They act in opposite directions
  along the line connecting them.)  Newton's law of equal action and
  reaction plus the experimental inverse square laws for acceleration
  toward the Sun and Earth requires that the observed ratio of
  acceleration constants K/k must equal the ratio of masses M/m (and
  the ratio of accelerations a/g).  Thus, the Sun must be 330,000
  times more massive that the Earth.</p>

<p class="justified">Furthermore, the ratio K/M must equal k/m.
  Newton called this ratio G.  This argument could have been made with
  Jupiter or any other planet or comet instead of Earth, so the ratio
  G&nbsp;=&nbsp;K/M must be the same for every body.  In other words,
  any two bodies attract each other with a force proportional to both
  masses, F&nbsp;=&nbsp;GMm/r&sup2;, where G is a universal constant
  of nature - the first such constant ever discovered.  Since the
  acceleration constants K&nbsp;=&nbsp;GM and k&nbsp;=&nbsp;Gm, this
  universal law of gravitational force identifies the <em>mass</em> of
  any object as the <em>source</em> of the gravitational acceleration
  of all other objects toward it.</p>

<hr/>

<p class="justified">The planets move according to Kepler's laws,
  which are equivalent to a single inverse square law: The planets are
  always accelerating directly toward the Sun at a rate inversely
  proportional to the Sun-planet distance squared.  Comets with highly
  elliptical orbits are accelerating according to the same law, that
  is, at the same rate as the planets when at the same distance from
  the Sun.  The Galilean moons of Jupiter obey the same law relative
  to Jupiter, but with a constant of proportionality a thousand times
  smaller than the planets and comets relative to the Sun.  Finally,
  the acceleration of our Moon is smaller than the acceleration of a
  falling apple by the square of the ratio of their distances from the
  center of the Earth.  The inverse square acceleration law constant
  for Earth is roughly three hundred times smaller than for
  Jupiter.</p>

<p class="justified">These are all statements of experimental fact - a
  distillation of decades, if not millenia, of careful observations of
  the sky.  This massive data reduction required great skill in
  mathematics, ranging from geometry and arithmetic through calculus -
  and every single one of those skills was developed, at least in
  part, to work specifically on the problem of planetary motion.</p>

<p class="justified">Separately, Newton formulated three general laws
  of motion by thinking about the mechanics of earthbound objects.
  His theory of gravity emerges when you interpret the experimental
  laws of planetary motion according to these general laws of
  mechanics.  This bold idea - essentially that the Earth and heavenly
  bodies are just very large rocks - follows directly from the
  experimental fact that apples and the Moon follow the inverse square
  acceleration law.  In other words, you already know that the gravity
  you feel on Earth is what holds the Moon in its orbit.  What if the
  pull of Earth extends all the way to the Sun?  Indeed, what if the
  Sun and Jupiter extert their own gravitational pull to hold their
  planets and moons in orbit?  What if every particle of matter pulls
  on every other?</p>

<p class="justified">Isaac Newton, the great mathematician,
  translated <a href="./seeing.html">Kepler's laws</a> of planetary
  motion into an <a href="./touching.html">inverse square law</a> of
  acceleration.  From the fact that the Moon, 60 times farther from
  Earth's center than we are, moves with a downward acceleration 3600
  (60&sup2;) times less than objects we drop on Earth's surface,
  Newton the great physicist deduced that the gravity we all feel at
  the surface of the Earth is exactly what keeps the Moon circling the
  Earth.  Gravity not holds us down, it is binds the whole solar
  system together.</p>

<p class="justified">The reason Newton was thinking about acceleration
  in the first place was to apply his general theory of mechanics -
  how things move - to the planets.  When he did, he discovered a
  universal law of gravity.  Universal gravitation explains why the
  Moon does not accurately orbit according to Kepler's laws, how the
  Moon and Sun produce ocean tides, the tiny deviations in in
  planetary orbits from Kepler's laws, and many other puzzles.</p>

<p class="justified">Here you will follow Newton's physical reasoning
  about mechanics and planetary motion.  Although Newton's model of
  gravity remains the easiest way to think about both solar system
  dynamics and motion in general, and despite its overwhelming success
  in describing a wide variety of phenomena, Einstein pointed out a
  different way to picture gravity.  Just as Newton's model of gravity
  began as a different, but equivalent, way to think about Kepler's
  laws of planetary motion, so Einstein's model of gravity begins as a
  different, but equivalent, way to think about Newton's inverse
  square force law.  All three pictures remain relevant today -
  astronomers choose the viewpoint best suited to describe the problem
  at hand.</p>

<h2>Mass and weight</h2>

<p class="justified">The translated Kepler's laws state that any
  bodies at the same distance from an attracting center will share a
  common <em>acceleration</em>, no matter their size: A cannonball
  and a bullet accelerate downward at the same rate, and a comet is
  accelerating toward the Sun at the same rate as Earth when it
  crosses Earth's orbit.  That means the gravitational <em>force</em>
  must be directly proportional to the mass of the falling body,
  according to Newton's second law of motion.</p>

<p class="justified">However, if gravity pulls you toward the Earth,
  then Newton's third law says you must pull up on the Earth with an
  equal force - the force down on you is the action, and the force up
  on the Earth is the equal and opposite reaction.  Similarly, if the
  gravity of the Sun holds the Earth in orbit, the Earth must pull
  back with the same force on the Sun.  The second law told you the
  Sun's gravitational force on the Earth is proportional to Earth's
  mass, since you know that any sized object at the same distance
  would share the same acceleration.  Since this is the
</p>

<p class="justified">Thus, conservation of momentum requires that the
  gravitational force between two bodies be proportional to both
  masses.  On the other hand, as far as Newton was concerned, the
  inverse square law for gravitational force is a purely experimental
  fact - a feature of Kepler's laws of planetary motion.
</p>

<h2>Equal and opposite reaction</h2>

<p class="justified">Newton knew from Kepler that the planets
  <em>accelerate</em> directly toward the Sun at a rate inversely
  proportional to the square of their distance.  Thus, since
  F&nbsp;=&nbsp;ma, the Sun must pull on the planet with
  a <em>force</em> proportional to the mass of the planet (and
  inversely proportional to the square of the distance).  But you also
  know that each planet (or both Jupiter and Earth, at least) causes
  things to accelerate toward it according to an inverse square
  distance law.  If this plantary inverse square law extends all the
  way to the Sun, then the planet must be causing the Sun to
  accelerate (very slightly) toward it as well - which means the
  planet pulls on the Sun with a force proportional to the solar
  mass.</p>

<p class="justified">But the force of the Sun pulling on the planet
  must equal the force of the planet pulling on the Sun, since actions
  must have equal and opposite reactions.  (The forces are clearly in
  opposite directions along the Sun-planet line.)  Since the pull of
  the Sun is proportional to the planet's mass and the pull of the
  planet proportional to the Sun's mass, the Sun-planet force must be
  directly proportional to <em>both</em> masses, as well as inversely
  proportional to the square of the distance.  From this, Newton
  proposed his law of universal gravitation - that a force acts
  between <em>any</em> pair of bodies directly proportional to both
  masses, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance
  between them, F&nbsp;=&nbsp;GMm/r&sup2.</p>

<p class="justified">Notice that the inverse square law acceleration
  constant for a body of mass M is GM, directly proportional to its
  mass.  Thus, Newton deduced that the Sun is roughly a thousand times
  the mass of Jupiter, while Jupiter is a bit over three hundred times
  the mass of Earth, since those are the ratios of their acceleration
  constants from Kepler's laws.  This is still the only way we know
  the masses of stars, planets, asteroids, or black holes - by
  measuring the accelerations of nearby objects.</p>

<p class="justified">On the one hand, universal gravitation represents
  a huge simplification - a single inverse square force law explains
  all manner of phenomena, from the motion of the planets or
  cannonballs to the tides.  On the other hand, you realize that in
  order to compute the motion of any object, you need to account for
  the forces between every rock and drop of fluid in the whole
  universe!  Every pair of rocks attract each other, so actually
  applying the "simple" law can become very complicated indeed.</p>
