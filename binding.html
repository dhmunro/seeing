<h2>Two stories of gravity</h2>

<p class="justified">Isaac Newton invented physics with his theory of
  universal gravitation to explain planetary motion: Every pair of
  bodies attract each another by a force directly proportional to both
  masses, and inversely proportional to the distance between them,
  F&nbsp;=&nbspGMm/r&sup2;.  As you will see, he arrived at this rule
  by applying his ideas about force and motion to the orbits of
  planets and moons in the solar system.  This combination of abstract
  theory - three mathematical laws of motion - with experimental
  observations - Kepler's description of planetary motion - has served
  as the archetype for physical science ever since.</p>

<p class="justified">The impact of Newton's work on the way we think
  about and work with nature cannot be overstated.  The excitement
  over understanding celestial mechanics very quickly spread
  throughout the scientific and engineering world as people began to
  apply Newton's mathematical modeling approach to countless different
  problems.  Newtonian mechanics ignited, then fueled the industrial
  revolution.</p>

<p class="justified">Shockingly, two centuries after Newton, Albert
  Einstein invented a completely different way to picture gravity,
  also based on general laws of mechanics, but updated to be
  consistent with new experiments involving the speed of light.  Like
  the step Newton took beyond Kepler, Einstein's new picture is
  carefully constructed to be equivalent to Newton's everywhere it had
  been tested up to that time.  Deviations begin only in cases
  involving bodies moving near the speed of light - thousands of times
  faster than anything in the solar system.  Therefore, unlike Newton,
  even today very few physicists - let alone engineers - ever use
  Einstein's theory of gravity.  Einstein's math is far more
  complicated, and errors in Newton's theory are usually
  negligible.</p>

<p class="justified">You will not find any details about Einstein's
  theory of gravity (a.k.a. general relativity) here.  However, you
  will learn how Newton's first law of motion defines the concept of a
  straight line in space-time - the four dimensional universe we all
  inhabit.  Once you know a straight line, you can recognize a curved
  one, and thus glimpse gravity from Einstein's perspective of curved
  space-time.</p>

<h2>Newton's laws of motion and gravity</h2>

<ol>
<li>A body at rest stays at rest, and a body in motion
  stays in motion in a straight line at a constant speed, unless
  acted on by a force.</li>
<li>The force on a body is directly proportional to, and in the same
  direction as, its acceleration.  The constant of proportionality is
  the mass of the body.</li>
<li>To every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.  That is,
  the forces of two bodies on each other are always equal and in
  opposite directions.</li>
</ol>

<p class="justified">The first law is, in a sense, a special case of
  the second - namely the case of zero force.  However, the first law
  really <em>defines</em> what "straight line" means in space-time
  according to Einstein, as you'll see later.  The second law is the
  iconic F&nbsp;=&nbsp;ma, which defines both force and mass in a
  deliberately circular manner.  The third law is what physicists now
  call <em>conservation of momentum</em>; it limits how bodies can
  interact.</p>

<p class="justified">Newton applied these laws to the case of the
  planets: At a given instant of time, you know from Kepler's laws
  that the Earth is accelerating directly toward the Sun at at a rate
  inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them,
  say a&nbsp;=&nbsp;K/r&sup2.  Furthermore, things accelerate directly
  toward the Earth according to a different inverse square law, say
  g&nbsp;=&nbsp;k/r&sup2, where the Earth's constant of
  proportionality k is smaller than the Sun's K by a factor of about
  330,000.  The second law of motion asserts that the force of the Sun
  pulling on Earth is proportional to the mass m of the Earth,
  F&nbsp;=&nbsp;ma, and also that the force of the Earth pulling on
  the Sun is proportional to the mass M of the Sun,
  F&nbsp;=&nbsp;Mg.</p>

<p class="justified">Enter the third law: The force of the Sun pulling
  on the Earth must equal the force of the Earth pulling on the Sun,
  F&nbsp;=&nbsp;ma&nbsp;=&nbsp;Mg.  (They act in opposite directions
  along the line connecting them.)  Newton's law of equal action and
  reaction plus the experimental inverse square acceleration laws for
  the Sun and Earth require that the observed ratio of acceleration
  constants K/k must equal the ratio of masses M/m (and the ratio of
  accelerations a/g).  Thus, the Sun must be 330,000 times more
  massive that the Earth.</p>

<p class="justified">Furthermore, the ratio K/M must equal k/m.  Call
  this ratio G.  You could have made this argument with Jupiter or any
  other planet instead of Earth, so the ratio G&nbsp;=&nbsp;K/M must
  be the same for every body.  In other words, any two bodies attract
  each other with a force proportional to both masses,
  F&nbsp;=&nbsp;GMm/r&sup2;, where G is a universal constant of nature
  - the first such constant ever discovered.  Since the acceleration
  constants K&nbsp;=&nbsp;GM and k&nbsp;=&nbsp;Gm, this universal law
  of gravitational force identifies the <em>mass</em> of any object as
  the <em>source</em> of the gravitational acceleration of all other
  objects toward it.</p>

<p class="justified">You have learned something completely new by
  applying the second and third laws of motion to the planets: Mass is
  the source of gravity!  Newton's reasoning is quite simple, but
  turns out to be very deep.  (The technically difficult part of
  universal gravitation is figuring out that Kepler's laws are
  equivalent to an inverse square law of acceleration - see
  <a href="./touching.html">Touching the Solar System</a>.)  The next
  step is to try to explain how the inverse square law of
  gravitational attraction operates in a geometrical way.</p>

<h2>Gravitational field lines</h2>

<p class="justified">Gravity is an acceleration vector at every point
  in space - the gravitational acceleration a small mass would
  experience at that point.  According to universal gravitation, to
  compute this, you have to add the acceleration vectors GM/r&sup2;
  directed toward every other particle of mass M and distance r in the
  universe.  Start by considering the acceleration produced by just a
  single idealized point mass - a particle so much smaller than its
  distance r that you can ignore its dimensions.  The planets are good
  examples of point masses, since they appear as mere pinpoints of
  light from anywhere else in the solar system.</p>

<p class="justified">A vector associated with every point in space is
  called a <em>vector field</em>.  Michael Faraday invented a way to
  visualize vector fields about a century after Newton's death.
  Faraday pictured lines of force filling space - a force field.  He
  was looking at the lines traced by iron filings on a sheet of paper
  with a magnet beneath, but the picture works for gravity as well.
  The idea is to connect the vectors into (possibly curved) lines -
  the path you would follow if you kept moving in the direction the
  vectors point.  So you picture the gravity of a point mass as myriad
  radial rays converging to the point, like long pins in a tiny
  pincushion.  Each ray is called a <em>field line</em>.  Notice that
  a field line is a <em>directed</em> line - like a one-way street.
  This field picture captures the direction of the acceleration vector
  everywhere, but at first glance it seems to lose any indication of
  magnitude - the length of the arrow.</p>

<p class="justified">However, the spacing between the lines decreases
  as they converge to the point mass.  You can define their density at
  a given position along some field line by imagining a small loop
  around the field line.  The loop will encircle other nearby lines,
  and you can define the density of field lines at that location to be
  the number of field lines threading through this tiny loop, divided
  by the area of the loop.  If you move farther away from the point
  mass, you need to scale up the diameter of the loop in proportion to
  the distance for it to encircle a fixed set of field lines, and the
  loop area scales as the square of the diameter - hence distance from
  the point mass.  Thus, the number of field lines per unit area
  scales inversely as the square of the distance!  If you make the
  total number of lines emanating from the point proportional to its
  mass, the magnitude of the gravitational acceleration will be
  proportional to the number of field lines per unit area!</p>

<p class="justified">So far, you assumed the plane of the loop was
  perpendicular to the field lines.  What happens if the plane of the
  loop is tilted relative to the field lines?  The number of lines
  threading the loop will be proportional to the area of the
  projection of the loop into the plane perpendicular to the field
  line.  The ratio of that projected area to the loop area when it was
  oriented normally is exactly the same as the ratio of the component
  of the acceleration normal to the tilted loop to the full
  acceleration, which is the component along the field line.
  Therefore, for any small loop, the <em>component</em> of
  acceleration normal to the plane of the loop is the number of field
  lines threading the loop per unit area.  More subtly, you need to
  choose the sign of the component to be negative if the directed
  field lines thread the loop in the direction opposite to its
  normal.</p>

<h2>Another view of the inverse square law</h2>

<p class="justified">Imagine a closed surface of any size (the surface
  of the Earth will soon become an example).  A point mass at some
  arbitrary position produces an acceleration which varies as you move
  around to different points on the surface.  The component of that
  acceleration normal to the surface (here the inward normal) thus
  also varies around the surface.  The field picture makes it easy to
  compute the area-weighted <em>average</em> of this normal component
  of acceleration over the whole surface:</p>

<p class="justified">Since the normal acceleration component is the
  number of lines per unit area threading any small loop on the
  surface, its area-weighted average is just the total number of field
  lines piercing the surface divided by the total surface area!  The
  one caveat is that you have to count each inward piercing line as
  plus one, and each outward piercing line as minus one, in order to
  be consistent about the sign of the acceleration relative to the
  surface normal direction you have selected.</p>

<p class="justified">There are two cases: First, if the point mass is
  outside the surface, then each field line pierces the surface twice
  - once going inward and a second time going outward, so the net
  number of piercings is zero.  Second, if the point mass is inside
  the surface, then each field line pierces just once, on its way
  inward.  (If the surface is not convex, there may be additional
  pairs of inward and outward piercings for some rays, but such pairs
  cancel each other.)  Thus, if the point mass is outside the surface,
  the mean value of the normal component of gravitational acceleration
  over the whole surface is always zero.  When the point mass is
  inside the surface, on the other hand, the mean value of the normal
  acceleration is always the total number of field lines converging on
  the point mass, divided by the total surface area.</p>

<p class="justified">A second point mass adds its acceleration vector
  to the acceleration from the first at every point in space.  Because
  the acceleration vectors simply add, the <em>averages</em> of the
  inward component of the acceleration also simply add.  Thus, if the
  new point is inside the surface, the average increases by the new
  mass divided by the surface area, otherwise the new mass contributes
  nothing.  Accumulating more point masses in this way, you find that
  the inverse square law of universal gravitation has this remarkable
  property:</p>

<p class="justified">The average value of the inward acceleration
  component over <em>any</em> closed surface is proportional the the
  total mass inside that surface divided by the surface area.</p>

<p class="justified">The constant of proportionality is 4&#x1D745;G,
  as you can work out from a spherical mass distribution.  This is a
  major result of vector calculus, called <em>Gauss's law</em>,
  discovered about a century after Newton.  Faraday's powerful field
  line picture has made it almost obvious, showing you its geometrical
  significance - total number of field line piercings over total
  surface area.  It is equivalent to the inverse square law, with the
  advantage that instead of "the square of the distance" you can think
  about the area of a surface.</p>

<h2>Testing the theory</h2>

<p class="justified">Newton faced an immediate technical problem with
  his theory of universal gravitation: In the argument that the
  Earth's gravity diminishes as the square of distance between your
  downward acceleration on its surface and the acceleration of the
  Moon in its orbit, you assumed that your "distance from the Earth"
  was the radius of the Earth, that is, your distance from the center
  of the Earth.  But with universal gravitation, the idea is that each
  little piece of the Earth - every rock and grain of sand and drop of
  magma in the whole ball - is individually pulling on you.  When you
  add up all those individual forces in different directions, why
  should you get the same answer as if all that mass were concentrated
  at the center of the Earth?  Unlike Newton, you can use Gauss's law
  to answer this question.</p>

<p class="justified">For any spherically symmetric object, the
  acceleration at its surface must point directly inward toward the
  center, and have the same value at every point of the surface -
  which is therefore the average inward component of the acceleration.
  Thus, the gravitational acceleration at the surface depends only on
  the total mass of the object divided by the surface area.  How the
  mass is distributed does not matter, as long as it is spherically
  symmetric (otherwise the acceleration would differ from place to
  place around the surface).  In particular, the acceleration at the
  surface is the same as if all the mass were condensed to a single
  point at its center.  You have resolved Newton's technical problem,
  and universal gravitation has passed an important consistency test.
  (And you can work out the 4&#x1D745;G constant mentioned above!)</p>

<p class="justified">Kepler's laws are equivalent to Newton's inverse
  square gravitation only when there are just two bodies, a smaller
  one orbiting a very much larger one.  The motion of the planets is
  dominated by the Sun; the motion of the moons by their planet.
  However, according to universal gravitation, all the planets and
  moons are attracting one another.</p>

<p class="justified">In fact, our Moon is accelerating toward the
  Earth at about 1/3600 of the "one gee" surface gravity you feel,
  while it is accelerating toward the Sun over twice as fast, about
  1/1650 gee.  Although the Earth accelerates toward the Sun at nearly
  the same rate, their distances from the Sun differ by up to one part
  in 400, so according to the inverse square law, the accelerations
  differ by up one part in 200.  Newton himself spent years
  calculating the details of how this time varying half percent
  difference perturbs the orbit of the Moon, showing that the gravity
  of the Sun accounts for all the irregularities of the Moon's orbit
  known since ancient times.</p>

<p class="justified">The idea that every mass attracts every other
  according to the inverse square law similarly explains a great many
  small deviations from Kepler's laws in the solar system as the
  result of attractions between multiple bodies.  In fact, unexplained
  perturbations in the orbit of Uranus led astronomers to predict and
  then discover Neptune.</p>

<p class="justified">Universal gravitation has immense built-in
  complexity because every pair of bodies attract each other, while at
  the same time a great simplicity in the rule of attraction between
  each pair.  Complexity is a crucial feature, inasmuch as the motions
  in the solar system really do become more and more intricate the
  closer you look.  Far from being completely deterministic, as people
  long assumed Newtonian mechanics to be, the fate of the solar system
  is provably unknowable on timescales of a hundred million years
  (called its <em>Lyapunov time</em>).</p>

<h2>Inverse square law, take three</h2>

<p class="justified">You already have two different ways to think
  about the inverse square law: Either each particle of matter causes
  everything else to accelerate toward it in proportion to its mass,
  or the area-averaged inward acceleration over any closed surface is
  proportional to the total mass inside the surface.  Just as you
  might want to view a scene from as many perspectives as possible,
  different ways to describe gravity are very helpful.</p>

<p class="justified">Gravitational potential provides a third
  important view of gravity.  The acceleration field, central to your
  first two pictures, is rather complicated - you have to imagine a
  vector arrow at each point in space.  The idea of potential is to
  reduce this vector to a single number at each point.  Of course, you
  still need to be able to reconstruct the acceleration from these
  numbers; one way to do that is to make the component of the vector
  in any direction be proportional to the rate of change of the
  numbers in that direction; in other words, the vector is the
  gradient.  For an arbitrary vector field, this isn't possible, but
  for the gravitational field, it is.  Why?</p>

<p class="justified">No need for potential here?  Just to compare mean
  value of component around loop to mean value of inward
  component on surface...</p>

<h2>Toward space-time geometry</h2>

<p class="justified">Motion occupies four dimensions: Three spatial
  coordinates for position in space, plus one time coordinate.  Of
  course, the time dimension is quite different from the other three,
  so it is not at all obvious how to combine space and time into
  anything like geometry.  However, the motion of solid bodies, or
  even of the tiniest particles of matter, stitches space and time
  together.  Although the analogy with Euclidean lines in three
  dimensional space is not complete, a particle of matter does trace a
  path through space-time called its <em>world-line</em>.  Objects
  collide if and only if their world-lines intersect in space-time,
  and the position and time of such a collision is called
  an <em>event</em> - the analog of a Euclidean point.</p>

<p class="justified">Newton thought of space-time as slices of
  constant time stacked like cards in a deck, with the positions of
  every particle of matter marked by a dot (an event!) on each card.
  While everyone agrees on what every card looks like, and on the time
  interval between cards (the thickness of a card), you don't need to
  square the deck the way it comes out of the box.  You can shear or
  fan the deck any way you please (as long as you don't change the
  order of the cards by shuffling).  No matter how you shear the deck,
  the world-lines of all the particles connect the cards together -
  you don't have any choice about how to draw world-lines.  You can't
  reorder the deck, since each card is a snapshot in time, and you can
  only smoothly shear or twist the cards - any discontinuous jump
  would break the world lines into two parts.  Motion of material
  particles is smooth.</p>

<p class="justified">Typically, you decide to stack the deck of
  constant time slices in order to make one particular body be "at
  rest".  That is, you tie the origin of your spatial coordinate
  system to some material object.  For example, ancient astronomers
  chose the Earth to be fixed in space, while Copernicus (and Kepler)
  chose the Sun.  You can argue about which choice makes the motion of
  the planets (the problem at hand for astronomers) simpler - and
  indeed what constitutes simplicity - but in the end, how you choose
  to stack the deck is up to you.  In fact, if you allow the
  orientation of each spatial slice to change, so that your spatial
  coordinate systems can rotate, then you have even more choices,
  corresponding to fanning the deck in addition to shearing it.  (For
  example, you may want to regard your observatory as motionless, in
  which case your coordinate system will rotate with the Earth.)</p>

<p class="justified">But Newton's laws of motion tell you how bodies
  move, that is, the shapes of their world-lines in space-time.
  According to the first law, a body with no net force acting on it
  moves at a constant speed (possibly zero) in a straight line.  This
  law very strongly constrains how you are allowed to stack your
  slices of constant time: You have to stack the deck in such a way
  that bodies with no net forces acting on them follow straight
  world-lines through space-time - otherwise Newton's first law of
  motion won't be obeyed!  A stacking which preserves Newton's first
  law is called an <em>inertial</em> frame of reference, as
  distinguished from an <em>accelerated</em> frame of reference.</p>

<p class="justified">From his stack-of-cards perspective of
  space-time, Newton interpreted his first law to mean that you should
  stack time slices to make the world-lines of small bodies at a great
  distance from any masses with significant gravity be straight lines
  (through space-time as well as through ordinary space).  The bodies
  comprising the solar system then inherit this stacking from the
  hypothetical very distant non-gravitating bodies.  Judged by such
  an "inertial at infinity" stacking, the velocities of planets and
  moons clearly accelerate, and therefore, according to the first law,
  must have a net force - the force of gravity - acting upon them.
  Planets and moons then follow curved - accelerated - paths through
  space-time, as well as through ordinary space.</p>

<h2>Curved space-time</h2>

<p class="justified">A non-inertial reference frame often offers the
  simplest framework for talking about a phenomenon.  For example, you
  usually choose the ground to be fixed when you discuss the motion of
  projectiles near Earth's surface, despite the fact that the ground
  rotates with the Earth, which rotates around the Sun - the ground is
  not an inertial frame!  When you do choose a rotating or otherwise
  accelerated reference frame, you must take into account forces, such
  as the centrifugal force and the Coriolis force, which depend on the
  acceleration of your reference frame, and which would not be present
  had you chosen an inertial frame.</p>

<p class="justified">These frame dependent forces share a very
  striking feature of gravitational force: The force on a body is
  always proportional to its mass - always producing the same
  acceleration independent of mass.  The reason is this common
  acceleration (or its negative) really belongs the reference frame.
  Einstein proposed that what Newton called gravitational force was of
  exactly the same character as, say, centrifugal force - namely that
  Newton has chosen to work in a non-inertial reference frame.</p>

<p class="justified">However, in order for Einstein's proposal to
  make any sense, he has to change the rules Newton played by: Newton
  only permitted you to make a single choice of reference frame - once
  you choose how to stack them, you have to stick with your choice
  once and for all.  Einstein dispensed with this one-choice rule,
  allowing you to change the way you stack the time slices as often as
  you please, choosing your stacking to apply for only a limited
  region of space and time around the current position of the bodies
  of interest.</p>

<p class="justified">If you allow your space-time model this
  flexibility, you can indeed eliminate all gravitational forces,
  instead ascribing the gravitational acceleration to your local
  inertial frame relative to Newton's global inertial frame.  In other
  words, Einstein permits gravity to locally bend the way you stack
  time-slices; gravity curves space-time.  (As long as nothing moves
  near lightspeed, the slices of constant time are always ordinary
  flat three dimensional space - the curvature is entirely in the
  stacking of these slices.)</p>

<p class="justified">To be clear, Einstein is not saying that Newton's
  reference frame is <em>wrong</em>, merely that it is
  a <em>choice</em>.  If you do choose to work in Newton's frame (as
  nearly everyone still does today), then you interpret the motion of
  bodies to be influenced by gravitational forces, exactly as Newton
  did.  What Einstein is saying is that instead of taking this view,
  you can instead imagine that any acceleration you observe belongs to
  a local inertial frame of reference, which is falling along with the
  object.  In other words, a body with no forces being applied to it,
  like an orbiting spacecraft, drags along its own inertial reference
  frame in which it is always at rest.  It is not the body that is
  falling around its orbit, but this constantly changing reference
  frame.
</p>

<p class="justified">What Newton calls an inertial frame is infinite
  in extent both in space and time, and only bodies infinitely far
  from any gravitating mass have motions satisfying his first law.
  With such a reference frame, you need to account for gravitational
  forces and their accelerations.  Einstein, on the other hand, allows
  you to choose local inertial reference frames, like the one moving
  along with a spacecraft, which are limited in extent both in space
  and time.  In those local frames, there are no gravitational forces
  or accelerations.  Instead, you need to slowly update the
  acceleration of your local inertial frame relative to Newton's
  global inertial frame.  What Newton calls gravitational
  acceleration, Einstein permits you to call (negative) acceleration
  of your local inertial frame.</p>

<p class="justified">Even Newton lamented the action-at-a-distance
  feature of his inverse square law.  Einstein is pointing out that
  this is really a feature of the global reference frame Newton is
  choosing.  If you use only local inertial frames, there is no longer
  a problem with action-at-a-distance, because you can dispense with
  the inverse square force law entirely.  But to do this, Einstein has
  paid a very heavy price - to track planetary orbits, he must patch
  together a huge number of tiny local inertial frames, following the
  planet as it moves around the Sun.  Newton's gravitational field he
  re-interprets as the (negative) acceleration of each of these
  reference frame patches, rather than as an acceleration caused by
  any gravitational force.  In other words, the gravitational field
  tells you the acceleration of a local inertial frame (relative to
  Newton's global frame), and the planet always travels in a straight
  line through space-time in its current local reference frame.</p>

<hr/>

<p class="justified">Once you have defined a straight world-line, you
  can, of course, recognize a curved world-line.  Newton's second law
  of motion supplies a measure of the curvature of the world-line of a
  body: its acceleration.  That is, acceleration is what you mean by
  the <em>curvature</em> of space-time - how much world-lines deviate
  from being straight.  The rubber sheets you sometimes see to
  illustrate Einstein's ideas about space-time curvature are terribly
  misleading.  Curved space-time has nothing to do with the three
  dimensions of space being warped, at least for low speed motions
  like the planets in the solar system.  Three dimensional space in
  the solar system is perfectly flat and Euclidean - the curvature is
  all in the time direction.  Acceleration is the space-time analog of
  curvature.</p>

<hr/>

<p class="justified">These are all statements of experimental fact - a
  distillation of decades, if not millenia, of careful observations of
  the sky.  This massive data reduction required great skill in
  mathematics, ranging from geometry and arithmetic through calculus -
  and every single one of those skills was developed, at least in
  part, to work specifically on the problem of planetary motion.</p>

<p class="justified">Separately, Newton formulated three general laws
  of motion by thinking about the mechanics of earthbound objects.
  His theory of gravity emerges when you interpret the experimental
  laws of planetary motion according to these general laws of
  mechanics.  This bold idea - essentially that the Earth and heavenly
  bodies are just very large rocks - follows directly from the
  experimental fact that apples and the Moon follow the inverse square
  acceleration law.  In other words, you already know that the gravity
  you feel on Earth is what holds the Moon in its orbit.  What if the
  pull of Earth extends all the way to the Sun?  Indeed, what if the
  Sun and Jupiter extert their own gravitational pull to hold their
  planets and moons in orbit?  What if every particle of matter pulls
  on every other?</p>

<p class="justified">Isaac Newton, the great mathematician,
  translated <a href="./seeing.html">Kepler's laws</a> of planetary
  motion into an <a href="./touching.html">inverse square law</a> of
  acceleration.  From the fact that the Moon, 60 times farther from
  Earth's center than we are, moves with a downward acceleration 3600
  (60&sup2;) times less than objects we drop on Earth's surface,
  Newton the great physicist deduced that the gravity we all feel at
  the surface of the Earth is exactly what keeps the Moon circling the
  Earth.  Gravity not holds us down, it is binds the whole solar
  system together.</p>

<p class="justified">The reason Newton was thinking about acceleration
  in the first place was to apply his general theory of mechanics -
  how things move - to the planets.  When he did, he discovered a
  universal law of gravity.  Universal gravitation explains why the
  Moon does not accurately orbit according to Kepler's laws, how the
  Moon and Sun produce ocean tides, the tiny deviations in in
  planetary orbits from Kepler's laws, and many other puzzles.</p>

<p class="justified">Here you will follow Newton's physical reasoning
  about mechanics and planetary motion.  Although Newton's model of
  gravity remains the easiest way to think about both solar system
  dynamics and motion in general, and despite its overwhelming success
  in describing a wide variety of phenomena, Einstein pointed out a
  different way to picture gravity.  Just as Newton's model of gravity
  began as a different, but equivalent, way to think about Kepler's
  laws of planetary motion, so Einstein's model of gravity begins as a
  different, but equivalent, way to think about Newton's inverse
  square force law.  All three pictures remain relevant today -
  astronomers choose the viewpoint best suited to describe the problem
  at hand.</p>

<h2>Mass and weight</h2>

<p class="justified">The translated Kepler's laws state that any
  bodies at the same distance from an attracting center will share a
  common <em>acceleration</em>, no matter their size: A cannonball
  and a bullet accelerate downward at the same rate, and a comet is
  accelerating toward the Sun at the same rate as Earth when it
  crosses Earth's orbit.  That means the gravitational <em>force</em>
  must be directly proportional to the mass of the falling body,
  according to Newton's second law of motion.</p>

<p class="justified">However, if gravity pulls you toward the Earth,
  then Newton's third law says you must pull up on the Earth with an
  equal force - the force down on you is the action, and the force up
  on the Earth is the equal and opposite reaction.  Similarly, if the
  gravity of the Sun holds the Earth in orbit, the Earth must pull
  back with the same force on the Sun.  The second law told you the
  Sun's gravitational force on the Earth is proportional to Earth's
  mass, since you know that any sized object at the same distance
  would share the same acceleration.  Since this is the
</p>

<p class="justified">Thus, conservation of momentum requires that the
  gravitational force between two bodies be proportional to both
  masses.  On the other hand, as far as Newton was concerned, the
  inverse square law for gravitational force is a purely experimental
  fact - a feature of Kepler's laws of planetary motion.
</p>

<h2>Equal and opposite reaction</h2>

<p class="justified">Newton knew from Kepler that the planets
  <em>accelerate</em> directly toward the Sun at a rate inversely
  proportional to the square of their distance.  Thus, since
  F&nbsp;=&nbsp;ma, the Sun must pull on the planet with
  a <em>force</em> proportional to the mass of the planet (and
  inversely proportional to the square of the distance).  But you also
  know that each planet (or both Jupiter and Earth, at least) causes
  things to accelerate toward it according to an inverse square
  distance law.  If this plantary inverse square law extends all the
  way to the Sun, then the planet must be causing the Sun to
  accelerate (very slightly) toward it as well - which means the
  planet pulls on the Sun with a force proportional to the solar
  mass.</p>

<p class="justified">But the force of the Sun pulling on the planet
  must equal the force of the planet pulling on the Sun, since actions
  must have equal and opposite reactions.  (The forces are clearly in
  opposite directions along the Sun-planet line.)  Since the pull of
  the Sun is proportional to the planet's mass and the pull of the
  planet proportional to the Sun's mass, the Sun-planet force must be
  directly proportional to <em>both</em> masses, as well as inversely
  proportional to the square of the distance.  From this, Newton
  proposed his law of universal gravitation - that a force acts
  between <em>any</em> pair of bodies directly proportional to both
  masses, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance
  between them, F&nbsp;=&nbsp;GMm/r&sup2.</p>

<p class="justified">Notice that the inverse square law acceleration
  constant for a body of mass M is GM, directly proportional to its
  mass.  Thus, Newton deduced that the Sun is roughly a thousand times
  the mass of Jupiter, while Jupiter is a bit over three hundred times
  the mass of Earth, since those are the ratios of their acceleration
  constants from Kepler's laws.  This is still the only way we know
  the masses of stars, planets, asteroids, or black holes - by
  measuring the accelerations of nearby objects.</p>

<p class="justified">On the one hand, universal gravitation represents
  a huge simplification - a single inverse square force law explains
  all manner of phenomena, from the motion of the planets or
  cannonballs to the tides.  On the other hand, you realize that in
  order to compute the motion of any object, you need to account for
  the forces between every rock and drop of fluid in the whole
  universe!  Every pair of rocks attract each other, so actually
  applying the "simple" law can become very complicated indeed.</p>
