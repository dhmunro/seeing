<h1>Touching the Solar System</h1>
<h2>How Newton recast <a href="index.html">Kepler's Laws</a>
  and grounded the heavens</h2>

<p class="justified">Isaac Newton discovered laws of motion which not
  only apply to ordinary things on Earth, but also govern the planets
  and moons in our solar system.  His analysis of planetary motion set
  the standard for all future generations of physicists - all of
  modern physical science is built up from Newton's ideas about how
  planets move.</p>

<p class="justified">A natural way to study motion is to begin with
  trajectory - the arc of a cannonball or the orbit of a planet.  You
  then come up with a rule for how the object advances along this
  trajectory in time.  This is exactly the form of Kepler's first two
  laws: The planet moves in an ellipse with the Sun at one focus, such
  that the line between the Sun and planet sweeps out equal areas in
  equal times.</p>

<p class="justified">Newton demoted the trajectory into a secondary
  feature of any motion, promoting instantaneous position, velocity,
  and acceleration to the primary status.  When a rigid body is free
  to move, Newton recognized that its velocity remains constant when
  no forces act on it.  Pushing on it changes its velocity directly,
  indirectly changing its trajectory.  That is, force causes
  acceleration, a rate of change of velocity.  This separation of
  cause - a force - from effect - an acceleration - turns out to be
  the crucial advantage of Newton's description of motion.</p>

<p class="justified">Newton was not only the greatest physicist of his
  age, but also its greatest mathematician.  He invented a new
  mathematical tool - the infinitessimal calculus - specifically to be
  able to work with motion in this radically new way.  With calculus,
  Newton could derive the trajectories and rules of movement from his
  more fundamental instantaneous positions, velocities, and
  accelerations.  In the jargon of calculus, velocity and acceleration
  are the <em>derivatives</em> - instantaneous rates of change - of
  position and velocity, and you <em>integrate</em> them - add them
  back up - to find the trajectory, or how they evolve over finite
  times.</p>

<p class="justified">Here, you will learn how Newton translated
  Keplerian orbits into the language of position, velocity, and
  acceleration he needed to apply his ideas about mechanics.  That is,
  you will get a glimpse of Newton the great mathematician, but not
  Newton the great physicist.  With one giant exception: Simply by
  recasting Kepler's laws into a statement about accelerations, Newton
  the physicist realized that the very same force of gravity that
  makes an apple fall is what holds the Moon in its orbit around the
  Earth, and what holds the planets in orbit around the Sun.  (That
  you can recognize gravity as a mathematical property of space and
  time without any direct appeal to mechanics, became the central idea
  of Einstein's general theory of relativity more than two centuries
  after Newton.)</p>

<p class="justified">A separate web page on
  <a href="./binding.html">universal gravitation</a> delves into the
  physics Newton discovered when he applied his general theory of
  mechanics to the special case of planetary motion.</p>

<h2>Trajectory in velocity space</h2>

<p class="justified">The basic idea of calculus is to break a
  continuous motion into a large number of small steps.  That is
  exactly how animation works - a rapidly displayed sequence of
  drawings which change only slightly from one to the next looks like
  a continuous motion.  The program which animates this ellipse
  computes a series of small steps in the position of the point on the
  ellipse using Kepler's equal area rule; by dividing each of these
  small displacements by the interframe time, it can also draw a good
  approximation to the instantaneous velocity vector at any time.</p>

<p class="justified">The direction of the velocity is always tangent
  to the trajectory - the ellipse in this case.  The magnitude of the
  velocity is the speed of the planet.  The scale of the velocity
  arrow in the drawing is arbitrary - the tip of the arrow is where
  the planet would have moved after some fixed but arbitrary time,
  had it continued in a straight line at a constant speed.  Instead of
  drawing the tail of the velocity arrow at the planet, you can put it
  at a fixed point - the origin of its own plane.  Each point in this
  plane represents a velocity rather than a position - a velocity
  space.</p>

<p class="justified">You know the tip of the radius vector traces an
  ellipse with its tail at one focus.  It looks like the tip of the
  velocity vector traces an eccentric circle, that is, a circle
  displaced from the tail of the arrow.  With a modern computer, you
  can verify this numerically, by taking smaller and smaller steps
  around the Keplerian ellipse and applying the equal area law between
  steps.  In fact, you can verify that the eccentricity of the circle
  in velocity space (the ratio of the displacement of its center from
  the origin to its radius) is identical to the eccentricity of the
  ellipse (defined below) in ordinary position space.</p>

<p class="justified">So the trajectory of a planet in velocity space
  is a circle with the same eccentricity as its ellipse in ordinary
  space.  The geometrical proof of this fact gives you some important
  additional insights into the connection between a planet's velocity
  and its position, as well as a glimpse of Newton's mathematical
  genius.  Here it is, in two parts.</p>

<h2>Tangent to an ellipse</h2>

<p class="justified">An ellipse is the set of points for which the sum
  of the distances from two fixed points - its foci - is constant.
  Eccentricity is the ratio of the distance between the foci and the
  fixed sum of distances; an ellipse with zero eccentricity is a
  circle.  Notice that the major axis, or largest diameter, of the
  ellipse equals that fixed sum of distances.  The minor axis is the
  smallest diameter, always perpendicular to the major axis.  Minor
  axis equals major axis for eccentricity zero, decreasing to zero as
  the eccentricity increases to one (the largest possible
  eccentricity).</p>

<p class="justified">Let S be the Sun at one focus and P be the planet
  on the ellipse.  If O is the other focus, then SP plus PO is a fixed
  constant for any position of P.  Extend SP to Q such that PQ equals
  PO.  Then SQ remains constant as P moves around the ellipse; in
  other words, SQ sweeps out a circle with center S.  Furthermore, OPQ
  is always an isoceles triangle, which means that P lies on the
  perpendicular bisector MP of OQ, where M is the midpoint of OQ.</p>

<p class="justified">In fact, MP must be tangent to the ellipse at P.
  To understand why, move P to any other point on the perpendicular
  bisector of OQ.  Since SPQ is no longer a straight line, the sum of
  SP and PQ, hence the sum of SP and PO, must be greater than SQ for
  any point on line MP other than the original P on SQ.  But since the
  ellipse is defined as all the points P with SP plus PO equal SQ,
  every point on line MP must lie outside the ellipse, except for the
  original P, which lies on it.  Since line MP touches the ellipse
  only at one point P, it must be tangent to the ellipse at P.</p>

<p class="justified">Because the tangent MP is perpendicular to OQ, if
  you rotate OQS ninety degrees counterclockwise (the direction the
  planet is moving here), then OQ will be parallel to the tangent of
  the ellipse at P.  That is, OQ now points in the direction of the
  velocity vector at P.  By construction, SQ is now always ninety
  degrees ahead of the planet radius vector SP - a fact that comes
  into play later.  For now, if you interpret the sides of OSQ as
  velocity vectors, you see that the velocity OQ of the planet,
  tangent to its ellipse, moves around an eccentric circle of radius
  SQ, displaced from zero velocity O by the fixed vector OS
  perpendicular to the major axis of the ellipse.  And the
  eccentricity of this circle is the same as the eccentricity of the
  ellipse by construction.</p>

<p class="justified">Thus, if the trajectory in velocity space is an
  eccentric circle, and the radius vector SQ in velocity space always
  leads the radius vector SP in ordinary space by ninety degrees, then
  the point P indeed moves around an ellipse (of the same eccentricity
  as the circle) with S at one focus.  To complete Newton's proof, you
  still need to demonstrate that SP sweeps over equal areas in equal
  times.  That is, you have proven that the velocity OQ points in the
  correct direction - tangent to the ellipse - but you still have to
  demonstrate that the length of OQ agrees with the speed of the
  planet according to Kepler's equal area law.</p>

<h2>Equal areas in equal times</h2>

<p class="justified">Acceleration is to velocity what velocity is to
  position - its rate of change.  Therefore, the acceleration vector
  of a planet is always tangent to its velocity space trajectory.  In
  this case, the velocity space trajectory is simply a circle, and the
  tangent to a circle is perpendicular to its radius, SQ.  But that
  means the acceleration vector of the planet at P always points in
  exactly the opposite direction as its radius vector SP - directly
  toward the Sun.  Accelerating directly toward or away from a fixed
  center turns out to be equivalent to Kepler's equal area law, as
  you will now see.</p>

<p class="justified">Absent any forces, a body moves in a straight
  line at a constant speed - Newton's first law of motion.  You can
  easily see that if the planet just flew past the Sun in a straight
  line at constant speed, it would sweep out equal areas in equal
  times: The areas are all triangles with a common height (the minimum
  Sun-planet distance) and equal bases (since the speed is
  constant).</p>

<p class="justified">Now suppose the velocity of the planet suddenly
  jumps to a new speed and direction.  When would such a jump leave
  the areas swept out in equal times unchanged?  The constant base of
  of the triangle is now the sun-planet vector at the moment of the
  jump, while the height of the triangle is the component of the
  velocity vector perpendicular to that base.  For the area to remain
  unchanged, only the component of velocity parallel to the Sun-planet
  line can change.  In other words, the change in velocity across the
  jump must point directly toward or away from the Sun.</p>

<p class="justified">Breaking the actual continuous acceleration into
  a large number of tiny jumps in velocity, just as you broke the
  continuous change in position into tiny steps for animation, you see
  that Kepler's law that equal areas are swept out in equal times will
  hold if, and only if, the planet only accelerates directly toward
  (or away from) the Sun.  This observation completes the proof that
  Kepler's first two laws of planetary motion mean that the trajectory
  of a planet in velocity space is an eccentric circle with the same
  eccentricity as its ellipse, rotated ninety degrees, so that its
  radius in velocity space is always ninety degrees ahead of its
  radius in ordinary space.</p>

<p class="justified">You now know the trajectories of a planet in both
  ordinary and velocity spaces.  However, Newton's program is to
  eliminate all trajectories in favor of instantaneous rates of
  change.  To do that, you need not only the direction of the
  acceleration, but also its magnitude.  In other words, you know that
  a planet always accelerates directly toward the Sun, and you now
  want to find how the magnitude of that acceleration changes as it
  moves around its orbit.</p>

<h2>Inverse square law</h2>

<p class="justified">The trajectories in position and velocity space
  are coupled by the fact that the two radius vectors SP and SQ are
  always exactly ninety degrees apart.  Thus, even though P and Q
  speed up and slow down as they move around S, the instantaneous
  angular speeds of SP and SQ are always equal.  Call that varying but
  common angular speed &omega;.</p>

<p class="justified">Consider first the motion of the planet around
  the Sun in ordinary space.  The planet's velocity has both a radial
  component, directly toward or away from the Sun, and a transverse
  component, perpendicular to that.  The angular speed of the planet
  around the Sun is independent of its radial velocity, and directly
  proportional to its transverse velocity.  In fact, if you measure
  &omega; in radians per unit time, the transverse velocity is simply
  the product &omega;r, where r is SP, the instantaneous distance of
  the planet from the Sun.</p>

<p class="justified">Now the rate the radius sweeps out area is
  directly proportional to the transverse velocity &omega;r, and
  independent of the radial velocity.  In fact, the transverse
  velocity is the rate of change of the height of the triangle with
  the radius vector r as its base.  Thus, the rate of change of area
  swept out by the radius is half of the product of r and the
  transverse velocity &omega;r, or half of &omega;r&sup2;.</p>

<p class="justified">Calling twice the rate the planet's radius sweeps
  out area L (a symbol used for angular momentum), you have
  L&nbsp;=&nbsp;&omega;r&sup2;.  But Kepler's second law says that
  (half of) L remains constant as the planet orbits.  Therefore, the
  angular speed of the planet around the Sun, &omega;, varies
  inversely as the square of its distance from the Sun,
  &omega;&nbsp;=&nbsp;L/r&sup2;, where the constant L is twice the
  rate the planet sweeps out area according to Kepler's second
  law.</p>

<p class="justified">Recall that the angular speed of the planet
  around the Sun &omega; is also the angular speed of the velocity
  radius SQ around its circular trajectory in velocity space.  Let u
  denote the constant length of SQ.  Since the acceleration is
  entirely transverse to SQ, its magnitude g is simply &omega;u, the
  velocity space analog of the formula for transverse velocity
  &omega;r.  Since the velocity radius u is constant, and &omega;
  varies inversely as the square of the distance r, the acceleration g
  must also vary inversely as the square of the distance.  In fact,
  g&nbsp;=&nbsp;uL/r&sup2;, so the constant of proportionality is
  uL.</p>

<p class="justified">You have proven that if a planet accelerates
  directly toward the Sun at a rate which varies inversely as the
  square of its distance from the Sun, then it will automatically obey
  Kepler's first two laws of planetary motion.  The trajectories in
  both velocity and ordinary space emerge by <em>integrating</em> this
  inverse square law, that is, by taking a large number of very small
  steps in time starting from the current position and velocity of the
  planet.  Again, in Newton's reformulation, the trajectories are
  secondary; what you need to study are the relationships between
  instantaneous position, velocity, and acceleration.</p>

<h2>Kepler's third law</h2>

<p class="justified">So far, all you know is that each planet
  accelerates toward the Sun at a rate inversely proportional to the
  square of its distance, g&nbsp;=&nbsp;uL/r&sup2;.  The constant of
  proportionality in this inverse square law might still be different
  from one planet to the next.  Recall that L is an area per unit
  time, so that uL has dimensions of length cubed divided by time
  squared - exactly the same dimensions as the constant of
  proportionality in Kepler's third law: the cube of the major axis of
  a planet's ellipse is proportional to the square of its orbital
  period.  How is uL related to a&sup3;/T&sup2;?</p>

<p class="justified">Since the ellipse is just a circle elongated on
  one axis, its area is &#x1D745;ab (the stretched &#x1D745;r&sup2;),
  where a and b are its major and minor semi-axes (that is, measured
  from the center like the radius of a circle).  Since the constant L
  is twice the area swept out per unit time,
  L&nbsp;=&nbsp;2&#x1D745;ab/T, where T is the period of the
  planet.</p>

<p class="justified">You can derive an expression for the velocity
  circle radius u from the rate area is being swept out at two
  specific points of its orbit: At perihelion, when the planet is
  closest to the Sun, L&nbsp;=&nbsp;(a-c)(u+w), where c is the
  distance from the center of the ellipse to one focus, and w is the
  displacement of the center of the velocity circle from zero velocity
  (so w is the length of OS).  Similarly, at aphelion, when the planet
  is farthest from the Sun, L&nbsp;=&nbsp;(a+c)(u-w).  Eliminating w
  from these two formulas results in
  u&nbsp;=&nbsp;La/(a&sup2;-c&sup2;).  The denominator is b&sup2;, so
  u&nbsp;=&nbsp;La/b&sup2;.</p>

<p class="justified">Combining these expressions for L and u, you find
  uL&nbsp;=&nbsp;4&#x1D745;&sup2;a&sup3;/T&sup2;.  Kepler's third law
  states that a&sup3;/T&sup2;, and hence the constant of
  proportionality uL, is the same for all the planets.  (To be clear,
  u and L individually differ from planet to planet, but their product
  uL is the same for all planets.)  Therefore, in fact, a single
  inverse square law for the acceleration, g&nbsp;=&nbsp;uL/r&sup2;,
  applies to every planet.</p>

<p class="justified">Kepler needed a separate third law to describe
  the connection among the orbital parameters of all the planets.  His
  description of this connection seems to create another puzzle - why
  the semi-major axis a and not some other dimension like the minor
  axis b or the perimenter of the ellipse?  And why the cube of the
  distance and square of the period?</p>

<p class="justified">Contrast this with Newton's description of the
  connection among the orbits of the planets: The Sun causes planets
  to accelerate directly toward it at a rate inversely proportional to
  their distance from it.  In fact, <em>any</em> object at the same
  distance from the Sun accelerates toward the Sun at that same rate,
  because by Newton's time, astronomers knew that comets travel around
  very eccentric Keplerian orbits, often falling from beyond Jupiter's
  orbit to within Earth's orbit.  There is only a single puzzle - why
  this inverse square law?  Newton acknowledged he had no clue about
  this final mystery with the quip, "Hypotheses non fingo."</p>

<h2>Touching the solar system</h2>

<p class="justified">The same year Kepler published his first two
  laws, 1609, Galileo invented the telescope.  He made several huge
  discoveries immediately: He saw the disks of the planets - planets
  are not simply points of light - a sight no one had seen before.
  Furthermore, the phases of Venus confirmed that planets are globes
  lit by sunlight, like the Moon.  And most importantly for this story
  about Newton, Galileo discovered the four largest moons of Jupiter.
  By Newton's time over half a century later, astronomers had studied
  Jupiter's moons in considerable detail.  They learned that the four
  moons orbited Jupiter according to Kepler's laws, except with a
  value of a&sup3;/T&sup2; about a thousand times smaller than for the
  planets or comets orbiting the Sun.</p>

<p class="justified">Newton devised a brilliant indirect test of
  Kepler's cube-square law for the case of the Earth: A cannonball
  accelerates downward at a rate of 9.8&nbsp;m/s&sup2; (as Galileo
  measured), independent of how fast it is moving horizontally.
  Newton realized that if its horizontal speed were high enough, the
  cannonball would follow the curve of Earth's surface, and (absent
  air resistance) it would continue to fall all the way around the
  Earth in a circular orbit.  He could use this hypothetical (to him)
  orbiting cannonball and the Moon to check Kepler's cube-square law
  for objects orbiting the Earth.</p>

<p class="justified">As you have seen, if objects accelerate toward a
  center at a rate inversely proportional to the square of their
  distance, they obey Kepler's laws.  The ancient Greeks had measured
  the radius of the Earth - 6380&nbsp;km - and the distance to the
  Moon - 60 Earth radii.  Since the Moon goes around with respect to
  the stars once more each year than with respect to the Sun, its
  sidereal period is about 27.3&nbsp;days.  For a roughly circular
  orbit, you have already worked out the acceleration
  g&nbsp;=&nbsp;&omega;v&nbsp;=&nbsp;&omega;&sup2;r, so the downward
  acceleration of the Moon works out to be 0.0027&nbsp;m/s&sup2;
  ((2&#x1D745;/(27.3&times;<wbr>24&times;<wbr>3600))&sup2;&times;<wbr>60&times;<wbr>6830000).
  If the inverse square law holds between the cannonball and the Moon,
  this should be 60&sup2;&nbsp;=&nbsp;3600 times less than
  9.8&nbsp;m/s&sup2;, and indeed it does "answer pretty nearly" in
  Newton's words.</p>

<p class="justified">Newton's reasoning here is arguably the greatest
  breakthrough in the history of science: The familiar force of
  gravity that pulls cannonballs downward near the surface of the
  Earth is the same force that holds the Moon in orbit around us.  And
  furthermore, the connection between the trajectories of cannonballs
  and of the Moon is none other than Kepler's laws for the motion of
  planets around the Sun, or of the Galilean moons around Jupiter.
  The millenia of labor poured into understanding the motion of the
  planets has brought Newton right back to the one force we all feel
  from birth - gravity.</p>

<h2>Gravity</h2>

<p class="justified">Newton's great insight - far more important than
  Archimedes's "Eureka" moment - is that his inverse square law of
  acceleration relates the gravity we all feel at the surface of the
  Earth to the acceleration of the Moon in its orbit around the Earth.
  Thus Newton knew that the Sun, Jupiter, and the Earth each cause
  objects to accelerate toward them at a rate inversely proportional
  to distance squared, with three different constants of
  proportionality.  Gravity may be the familiar force you've always
  known, but it does far more than just pull you down to Earth.
  Gravity extends upward throughout the solar system and beyond,
  binding the moons to their planets and the planets to the Sun.  We
  sense the solar system by touch as well as by sight, or at least we
  all feel the force holding the whole thing together.</p>

<p class="justified">Notice that we never used Newton's laws of motion
  in proving the equivalence of the inverse square law of planetary
  acceleration to Kepler's laws.  We mentioned his laws of motion
  merely to motivate why instantaneous position, velocity, and
  acceleration is an interesting way to describe motion.  After all,
  the more natural way to think about motion is in terms of
  trajectory, like Kepler's laws.  The inverse square law of
  acceleration is simply a description of how planets and moons and
  earthbound projectiles move.  All the rules of motion discussed so
  far merely summarize a mountain of observations of how all these
  objects do, in fact, move.</p>

<p class="justified">However, Newton also developed a general theory
  of mechanics - how things move - including his iconic formula
  F&nbsp;=&nbsp;ma.  When he applied his mechanics to the case of
  planetary motion, Newton had a second great insight, his theory of
  universal gravitation.  Universal gravitation offers an explanation
  for the differences in the constant of proportionality in the
  inverse square acceleration laws observed for the Sun, Jupiter, and
  Earth - it is no longer simply a description of how things move.  It
  also explains why the Moon does not accurately move in a Keplerian
  ellipse, and correctly predicts its observed orbit.  But all this
  belongs to a separate story about
  <a href="./binding.html">binding the universe</a> together with
  gravity.</p>
