<h1>Touching the Solar System</h1>
<h2>How Newton recast <a href="index.html">Kepler's Laws</a>
  and grounded the heavens</h2>

<p class="justified">Isaac Newton discovered laws of motion which
  not only apply to ordinary things on Earth, but also govern the
  planets and moons in our solar system.  His analysis set the
  standard for all future generations of physicists; our mantra ever
  since has been, "Think like Newton."</p>

<p class="justified">The natural way to study motion is to begin with
  trajectory - the arc of a cannonball or the orbit of a planet.  You
  then come up with a rule for how the object advances along this
  trajectory in time.  Galileo discovered that the canonball moves in
  a parabola with a constant horizontal velocity, and this is exactly
  the pattern of Kepler's first two laws: The planet moves in an
  ellipse with the Sun at one focus, such that the line between the
  Sun and planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times.</p>

<p class="justified">Newton demoted the trajectory into a secondary
  feature of any motion, promoting instantaneous position, velocity,
  and acceleration to be the primary features.  When a rigid body is
  free to move, Newton recognized that its velocity remains fixed when
  no forces act on it.  Pushing on it changes its velocity directly,
  only indirectly changing their position.  That is, force causes
  acceleration, the rate of change of velocity.</p>

<p class="justified">Newton was not only the greatest physicist of his
  age, but also its greatest mathematician.  He invented a new
  mathematical tool - the infinitessimal calculus - specifically to be
  able to work with motion in this radically new way.  With calculus,
  Newton could derive the trajectories and rules of movement from his
  more fundamental instantaneous positions, velocities, and
  accelerations.  In the jargon of calculus, velocity and acceleration
  are the <em>derivatives</em> - instantaneous rates of change - of
  position and velocity, and you <em>integrate</em> them to find the
  trajectory - how they evolve over finite times.</p>

<p class="justified">So what are the velocity and acceleration of a
  planet according to Kepler's laws?</p>

<h2>Kepler's Second Law</h2>

<p class="justified">The radius vector from the Sun to a planet sweeps
  out equal areas in equal times as the planet moves.  Thus, Kepler's
  second law is already a statement about a rate of change: The area
  per unit time a planet's radius sweeps out is some fixed
  constant.</p>

[Picture shows ellipse with fixed time/area sector drawn.]

<p class="justified">Newton's first law states that absent any forces,
  a body will move in a straight line at a constant speed.  Then the
  radius vector from an arbitrary fixed point to the body will sweep
  out equal triangular areas in equal times: The area is half the
  height (distance from the fixed point to the line) times the base.
  The base is the same for equal times since the body moves at constant
  speed.  The rate area is swept out is just half the height times the
  speed.</p>

[Picture changes to straight line motion under point with fixed
 time/area triangle drawn.]

<p class="justified">The radius and velocity vectors are Newton's
  preferred way to describe motion.  Notice that if you decompose the
  velocity vector into components in the radial and transverse
  directions, then the right triangle with the radius as its
  hypotenuse and height as one side is similar to the triangle with
  the whole velocity as its hypotenuse and the transverse velocity
  component as one side.  Thus the rate of change of area is also half
  the product of the radius and the transverse component of
  velocity.</p>

[Picture changes to show similar position and velocity triangles, then
 the two equal area hs = rv triangles.]

<p class="justified">If the velocity suddenly changes - so quickly
  that the change in position is negligible - then the rate of change
  of area will remain unchanged if and only if the transverse
  component of velocity remains unchanged.</p>

[Picture changes to show a deflecting trajectory, with the equal area
 triangles before and after the deflection.  Add more and closer spaced
 radial deflections until trajectory becomes smooth curve.]

<p class="justified">When you say that a planet moves around the Sun,
  what you are really saying is that its velocity is continually being
  deflected towards the Sun.  You just reasoned that if the rate the
  radius vector sweeps out area remains constant, then only the radial
  component of velocity can be changing.  (Although the transverse
  velocity component does not change over infinitessimal times, over
  finite times it does change because the radial and transverse
  <em>directions</em> are changing!)  That is, Kepler's second law
  means that a planet's acceleration is directly toward the Sun.</p>

[Picture changes to show the original elliptical trajectory with the
 moving shaded sector, then adding the velocity vector and inward
 radial acceleration vector, finally fading out the shaded sector
 and trajectory for just the velocity and radial acceleration
 vectors.]

<p class="justified">So the planets are accelerating directly toward
  the Sun.  Newton realized that "sweeping out equal areas in equal
  times" is just a rather clumsy and roundabout way to say that the
  planets are being pulled straight toward the Sun.</p>

<h2>Three ways to define an ellipse</h2>

<p class="justified">Kepler's first law is much harder to recast in
  Newtonian terms.  You need to know many properties of an ellipse and
  its foci to even get started.  Precisely what is an ellipse and what
  are its foci?  In simplest terms, an ellipse is a circle elongated
  along one axis.  More precisely, an ellipse is the shape of a
  section of a right circular cylinder cut by a plane not normal to
  its axis - think of slicing a cucumber on a bias.</p>

[Picture of circle stretching into ellipse, then add 3D cylinder with
 slicing plane and rotate in 3D to an orientation you might see if you
 were slicing a cucumber.]

<p class="justified">To find one focus of this ellipse, introduce a
  sphere of the same radius as the cylinder and slide its center along
  the axis of the cylinder until it just touches the cutting plane.
  That tangency point is one focus of the ellipse.</p>

[Picture shows sphere moving down axis, stopping when it touches the
 cutting plane, then rotating to show face on view ellipse with focus,
 then back to side on view of cylinder.]

<p class="justified">Let point S be the focus, point C be the center
  of the ellipse (where the cylinder axis intersects the cutting
  plane), point B be the point on the ellipse farthest from C on the
  same side as S, and point A be on the cylinder such that CAB is a
  right angle whose plane is normal to the cutting plane.  CA is the
  radius of the sphere and cylinder, or half the short axis of the
  ellipse, CB is half the long axis of the ellipse, and BA equals CS,
  the distance of the focus from the center of the ellipse.  The ratio
  CS/CB (or BA/CB) is the eccentricity, or &epsilon;, of the ellipse.
  As &epsilon; varies from 0 to 1, the ellipse varies from a circle to
  an infinitely elongated cigar.</p>

[Picture labels S, rolls to top view of slice, then triangle CAB fades
 in.  A copy of this triangle rotates and flips to show CS=AB -
 perhaps rolling a bit to turn the flip into a continuous rotation
 about CA.]

<p class="justified">Choose any point on the ellipse P.  SP is tangent
  to the sphere at S.  Draw DP along the surface of the cylinder
  parallel to its axis, with D on the circle where the sphere touches
  the cylinder.  Then DP has the same length as SP, because all
  tangents to a sphere drawn from a point outside the sphere have the
  same length.  Slide a copy of the tangent circle down the cylinder
  until the focus S lies in the plane of this new circle, and extend
  DP to reach the new circle at E.  Draw right triangle GED with G in
  the cutting plane and GED perpendicular to the cutting plane.  Note
  that triangle GEP is always the same shape as CAB - only its size
  changes as P moves around the ellipse.  Therefore PE/GP equals the
  eccentricity &epsilon;.  In other words, PE equals &epsilon;GP - a
  fixed fraction of GP.</p>

[Picture mutates to show construction of DP, highlighting SP and DP in
 the same color, and letting P orbit the ellipse once to show SP=DP.
 Show second circle moving along cylinder, and intersection line of
 its plane with cutting plane, stopping when that intersection line
 reaches S.  Add point G on that line and extend DP to E to form right
 triangle GED.  Again, let P orbit once showing constancy of DE.
 Finally, roll cylinder to top view to show GEP is same shape as CAB.]

<p class="justified">Now the length of DE is just the distance between
  the two circles, no matter what P you choose.  Since DP equals SP,
  the sum SP+PE must remain constant (equal to DE) as P moves around
  the ellipse.  Note that you need to regard PE as an algebraic
  quantity with a sign, positive when P is between D and E, but
  negative when E is between D and P.  This relationship provides a
  second way to define the ellipse: The locus of all points P such
  that SP+&epsilon;GP equals a constant.  If you write &epsilon;GP for
  PE here, then unlike the sliced cylinder definition of an ellipse,
  this definition doesn't involve the third dimension.</p>

[Picture rolls away from top view of slice, then shows how GEP changes
 as P orbits the ellipse, and how the sign of PE changes.  Rotate to
 view ellipse plane.  Finally, let P orbit ellipse to show how
 SP+&epsilon;GP remains constant?]

<p class="justified">You can slide a second sphere into the opposite
  end of the cylinder, defining a second focus, call it F.  As you did
  for the first focus, connect an arbitrary point P on the ellipse to
  point H on the circle where the second sphere touches the cylinder.
  Now FP equals HP, just as before you found SP and DP equal.  But
  DP+PH=DH, which is always the distance between the centers of the
  two spheres.  DH equals the long axis of the ellipse, twice CB.
  Thus the ellipse is the set of points P for which SP+FP=DH, that is,
  for which the sum of the distances from its two foci is a fixed
  constant equal to the long axis of the ellipse.  Again, this is a
  purely two dimensional definition.</p>

[Picture rotates back to 3D view.  Second sphere appears and slides to
 second focus.  Circle plane containng S slides to position where
 second sphere touches cylinder.  HP and FP appear in same color,
 contrasting with SP and DP to show equal length pairs.  P orbits
 ellipse once to show DH stays constant length.  Roll to top view to
 show DH equals long axis of ellipse.]

<p class="justified">In the plane of the ellipse, you can extend SP to
  a point Q, where PQ equals FP.  As P moves around the ellipse, Q
  moves around a circle, since SQ=SP+PF remains constant.  Relative to
  point F, SQ is an eccentric circle.  Its eccentricity - offset of
  its center S from F as a fraction of its radius - is FS/SQ.  Notice
  that FS/SQ equals &epsilon;, the same as the eccentricity of the
  ellipse.</p>

[Picture rotates back to ellipse plane, then copy of FP rotates around
 P to Q.  P orbits the ellipse, tracing the circle SQ.  P pauses when
 FP vertical to show circle and ellipse have same eccentricity.]

<h2>Relation between eccentric circle and ellipse</h2>

<p class="justified">You also need to know how to construct the
  tangent to an ellipse.  (A planet's velocity is tangent to its
  ellipse!)  Draw the midpoint M of FQ, and consider a point N on the
  line MP, the perpendicular bisector of FQ.  When N is at P, it is on
  the ellipse, so that SN+NF=DH.  At any other point, SN+NF=SN+NQ must
  be larger, since SPQ is a straight line.  Thus, every other point N
  on MP is outside of the ellipse, so that MP must be tangent to the
  ellipse at P, since it intersects the ellipse only at the one point
  P.</p>

[Picture adds M and line through MP, then N on MP and bent line SNQ,
 as well as FN. N slides back and forth over P showing that FN+SN
 always greater than FP+SP, so N outside ellipse.]

<p class="justified">Extend QS to I such that FIQ is a right angle,
  making IQ the projection of FQ onto SQ.  Notice that the ratio IS/SQ
  is the product of IS/FS and &epsilon;=FS/SQ.  Triangles SPG and FSI
  are the same shape, so that IS/FS equals GP/SP, and the ratio IS/SQ
  equals &epsilon;GP/SP.  Remember that SP+&epsilon;GP is the same for
  every point P, which means that SP times (1+&epsilon;GP/SP) is
  constant, independent of P.  But the length of IQ is SQ+IS, which is
  the constant length SQ times (1+&epsilon;GP/SP).  Since IQ varies in
  direct proportion to (1+&epsilon;GP/SP) as P moves around the
  ellipse, and SP varies inversely as this same quantity, the product
  of SP and IQ remains unchanged as P moves.</p>

[Picture removes N, fades M and line MP.  Adds I and highlights
 SPG and FSI, highlighting IS/FS and GP/SP.  No obvious way to picture
 the remainder of this argument, but should probably have P orbit the
 ellipse while highlighting IS+SQ and EP+SP to indicate they are
 split in the same ratio.]

<p class="justified">Now rotate FIQ ninety degrees around S.  FQ is
  now parallel to the ellipse tangent at P, so PJ, a translated copy
  of FQ, will be tangent to the ellipse at P.  Let SK be a second
  translated copy of FQ.  Then SPJK is a parallelogram with base SP
  and height IQ, so its area is the invariant product SP times IQ.
  Therefore the area of SPJK does not change as P moves around the
  ellipse!  Notice that you can apply an arbitrary scale factor to
  triangle FIQ without changing the fact that the area of SPJK is
  independent of P.</p>

[Picture rotates FIQ, shows the copies of FQ translating to P and S -
 the copy that translates to S also translates a copy of IQ, to show
 that IQ is the height of SPJK.  Highlight area, and let P move once
 around the ellipse.  Lastly, scale FIQ to smaller size and orbit again.]

<h2>Kepler's First Law</h2>

<p class="justified">If FQ (or PJ) were the velocity vector of the
  planet at P, then the rate of change of area in the instantaneous
  version of Kepler's Second Law would be the area of triangle SPJ,
  which is just half the constant area SPJK.  Hence, not only is FQ
  tangent to the ellipse at P, but its length changes in exactly the
  right way to satisfy the equal areas in equal times law.  Thus,
  you've demonstrated that the velocity vector of a planet P traces an
  eccentric circle with eccentricity equal to the eccentricity of its
  ellipse, but rotated ninety degrees!</p>

[Picture separates FSQ and velocity circle from SP and ellipse, then
 adds a small copy of FSQ with F at P.  SP and all three sides of FSQ
 are now drawn as vector arrows.  Letter labels fade.  P orbits ellipse
 a couple of times.  Then eccentricity changes for another couple of
 orbits, after which eccentricity returns to original.]

<p class="justified">To complete Newton's program, you need only find
  the force law, that is, the acceleration.  Since the radius of the
  velocity circle is unchanging with time, the velocity change is
  always tangent to that circle, ninety degrees ahead of SQ, which
  itself has been rotated to be ninety degrees ahead of SP.  Thus the
  direction of the acceleration is always exactly opposite SP, that
  is, directly toward the Sun, as you had already deduced.</p>

[Picture adds acceleration arrow to tip of velocity on velocity diagram,
 and possibly in the position diagram as well in a common color to
 show how it remains exactly opposite the radius vector SP.]

<p class="justified">As for the magnitude of the acceleration, it is
  the instantaneous angular speed (in radians per unit time) of Q
  around the velocity circle, times the radius SQ of the velocity
  circle.  Since SQ is always ninety degress from SP, the angular
  speed of Q around S is identical to the angular speed of P around S.
  But the angular speed of P around S times the distance SP is the
  transverse velocity of P, and the transverse velocity times SP is
  twice the rate SP sweeps out area.  Hence the rate area is being
  swept out, which is a constant, is (half) the angular speed times
  the square of SP.  In other words, the instantaneous angular speed
  of a planet varies inversely as the square of SP.  Since
  acceleration is the constant SQ times this angular speed, you have
  the force law:</p>

[Indicate angular speed in both diagrams, with P orbiting ellipse.]

<p class="justified">The acceleration of a planet is always directly
  toward the Sun with magnitude inversely proportional to the square
  of its distance from the Sun.  If the acceleration of a planet obeys
  this inverse square law, then it will move around an ellipse with
  the Sun at one focus according to the equal area law.  Its velocity
  vector will move around an eccentric circle with the same
  eccentricity as its ellipse, but rotated ninety degrees.  You have
  completed Newton's program, describing orbits in terms of their
  instantaneous position and velocity, plus a force law.</p>

[Animation making it obvious that angular speed is varying inversely
 with distance?]

<h2>Kepler's Third Law</h2>

<p class="justified">So far, all you know is that each planet
  accelerates toward the Sun at a rate inversely proportional to the
  square of its distance.  The constant of proportionality in this
  inverse square law might still be different from one planet to the
  next.  But notice that the dimensions of this constant of
  proportionality are acceleration times length squared, or length
  cubed divided by time squared - exactly the same dimensions as the
  constant of proportionality in Kepler's cube-square law.  Does a
  single inverse square law explain the accelerations of all the
  planets?</p>

<p class="justified">Since the ellipse is just a circle elongated on
  one axis, its area is A=&#x1D745;ab (the stretched
  &#x1D745;r&sup2;), where a and b are its long and short semi-axes
  (that is, measured from the center like the radius of a circle).  If
  T is the period of the planet, then the constant area swept out per
  unit time is A/T, and you know the constant of proportionality in
  the inverse square law for the angular speed is just twice this, or
  2&#x1D745;ab/T.  If v is the constant radius of the eccentric
  velocity circle, then the constant of proportionality in the inverse
  square law for the acceleration is v times 2&#x1D745;ab/T.</p>

[Show area change by stretching rectangle with inscribed circle?]

<p class="justified">But twice the area rate 2&#x1D745;ab/T is also
  the transverse velocity times the planet radius SP.  Choose the
  instant when SP is perpendicular to the long axis of the ellipse
  because at that moment the transverse velocity equals the constant
  radius of the eccentric velocity circle, call it v.  Going all the
  way back to the diagrams you drew of the ellipse as a cylinder
  slice, at this moment the planet radius SP is b&sup2;/a.  Hence,
  vb&sup2;/a = 2&#x1D745;ab/T, or v = 2&#x1D745;a&sup2;/(Tb).</p>

[Picture shows this position of SP and v, rotate in 3D ending at top
 view of slice to show DE is b2/a.]

<p class="justified">Putting these two formulas together, the constant
  of proportionality in the inverse square law for acceleration is
  4&#x1D745;&sup2;a&sup3;/T&sup2;.  But Kepler's Third Law is that
  a&sup3;/T&sup2; is the same for every planet, so the constant of
  proportionality in Newton's inverse square law for the acceleration
  is the same for every planet!</p>

<p class="justified">Thus, all three of Kepler's laws follow from the
  single statement that a planet accelerates directly toward the Sun
  at a rate inversely proportional to the square of its distance from
  the Sun.</p>
